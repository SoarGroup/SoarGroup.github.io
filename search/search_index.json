This section assumes that you just want to make things as fast as possible after you have finished debugging your application. Debugging is an inherently slow process, so these tips will be less helpful while you\u2019re still debugging.</p> <p>Compile with optimizations turned on. In Visual Studio this means doing a release build. On Linux and OS X, the default settings are probably sufficient, but you can experiment with new settings if you want (let us know if you find better settings).</p> <p>Put primary application and Soar in the same process. That is, use <code>CreateInNewThread</code> or <code>CreateInCurrentThread</code>, not <code>CreateRemoteConnection</code>. Using a remote kernel means socket communication is used, which is slow.</p> <p>Don\u2019t register for unnecessary events. Every event that is registered for causes extra work to be done. Try to find an appropriate event to register for so you don\u2019t end up getting more event calls than you actually need \u2013 that is, try to avoid registering for events which occur more frequently than you need and then filtering them on the application side.</p> <p>Don\u2019t connect the debugger. Connecting the debugger creates a remote connection and also registers for several events. Set <code>watch level 0</code>. Even if you don\u2019t have a client registered for any of the print or XML events, work is still done internally to generate some of the information that would have been sent out. Setting <code>watch level 0</code> avoids this work.</p> <p>Disable monitor productions. Again, even if no client is registered to print out the text of monitor productions, work is still done internally to prepare the text. Monitor productions can be disabled by excising them or commenting them out, but an easier method is to have each monitor production test a debug flag in working memory which is set by some initialization production or operator. Thus all of the monitor productions can be turned on or off by changing one line of code.</p> <p>Disable timers. Soar uses timers internally to generate the output of the stats command. If you don\u2019t need this information, you can use the <code>timers \u2013off</code> command to disable this bookkeeping. This can make a significant difference in the <code>watch 0</code> case.</p> <p>Avoid running agents separately. Instead of calling <code>RunSelf</code> or <code>RunSelfTilOutput</code> on each agent, just call RunAllAgents? on the kernel itself. This runs all agents together and avoids the overhead of running them separately. The absolute best you can do is to call <code>RunAllAgentsForever</code> as described in section 2.4 \u2013 this avoids repeatedly calling the <code>run</code> functions at all and will make it easier to stop and restart your application from the debugger (or other clients).</p> <p>In the case where the absolute best performance under SML is desired, use <code>CreateKernelInCurrentThread</code> instead of <code>CreateKernelInNewThread</code> and set the \u201coptimized\u201d flag to true in the parameters passed to <code>CreateKernelInCurrentThread</code>. This means Soar will execute in the same thread as your application. Without this each call to and from the Soar kernel requires a context switch (assuming a single processor machine). This method also eliminates the thread which polls for new events. This means you must poll for the events yourself by periodically calling <code>CheckForIncommingCommands</code>, which is a little more work for the programmer.</p> <p>Turn off <code>autocommits</code>. By default, SML sends WME changes to the kernel as soon as they are requested. Performance can be improved by telling SML to buffer all WME changes until an explicit call is made to commit the changes. Turning off <code>autocommits</code> is done via a call to <code>mykernel-&gt;SetAutoCommit(false)</code>. Explicitly committing WME changes is done via a call to <code>myagent-&gt;Commit()</code>. Sending all the changes at once will give a small performance boost in cases where Soar and the environment are in the same process, and a large performance boost when they are communicating over sockets. Be careful, though - the agent won't see any WMEs until they have been committed (and then not until the next input phase, as usual), and all WMEs must be committed before doing an <code>init-soar</code>, which generally means before giving the user control (since someone could call <code>init-soar</code> from an attached debugger). This typically means committing all WMEs after updating an agent's <code>input-link</code>.</p>","tags":["Java","C++","agent development","sml","kernel programming"]},{"location":"development/SoarTechnicalFAQ/#when-can-i-safely-make-changes-to-the-input-link","title":"When can I safely make changes to the input-link?","text":"<p>A Soar agent only receives input during the input phase and it does this through an input phase callback while the agent is running. SML allows the environment to change the input-link at other times and those changes are buffered until the next input phase. This means you have several options for handling input: You can register for <code>smlEVENT_BEFORE_INPUT_PHASE</code> and make changes to the input link at that time. This is very close to the way the kernel naturally handles input but will often be relatively slow if Soar is running a lot faster than the environment is changing (a common situation) as this event needs to be sent each decision cycle for each agent, generating a lot of communications traffic.</p> <p>Another option is to register for an update event (<code>smlEVENT_AFTER_ALL_OUTPUT_PHASES</code> and <code>smlEVENT_AFTER_ALL_GENERATED_OUTPUT</code>), check for output at that time and create new inputs immediately. These events are called after the output phase has completed and the new input link changes will be buffered until the next input phase. This is the most common choice in existing SML environments.</p> <p>A third option is to register an output event handler, which looks for a particular attribute to be added to the output link and only then calls the registered function. This handler will be called during the output phase and again, new input will be collected and buffered until the next input phase of the agent. In general, any run event (<code>smlRunEventId</code>) or update event (<code>smlUpdateEventId</code>) is a good candidate to use for changing the input-link. Other events may not be appropriate to use. One particular example is <code>smlEVENT_BEFORE_AGENT_REINITIALIZED</code> and <code>smlEVENT_AFTER_AGENT_REINITIALIZED</code>. These events fire during an init-soar call and are dangerous to use because the system is actively destroying the entire input link and then recreating it to match the last structure defined by the environment. This happens automatically and gives the agent its best chance to continue executing again. However, if you register for these events yourself and try to change the input link during those events, the resulting behavior is likely to depend on whether the system callback occurs before or after your callback. With care this can probably all work out correctly, but you should be aware of what's going on. Similarly, making changes to I/O in response to a production firing or other such events is potentially dangerous as you might be changing input within a given execution phase rather than before or after it, leading to unpredictable results. These events are best used for monitoring Soar's behavior rather than changing it.</p>","tags":["Java","C++","agent development","sml","kernel programming"]},{"location":"development/SoarTechnicalFAQ/#what-do-i-need-to-know-about-threads-in-my-sml-applications","title":"What do I need to know about threads in my SML applications?","text":"<p>You generally want to keep all interactions with the kernel in a single thread. You can make calls from other threads, but they will block if Soar is busy doing something else - like running - until the command completes. This requirement raises a few issues: If you're working with a GUI, then the handler for a \"run button\" shouldn't just call run on the kernel. If it does the GUI will wait for the run to complete before responding. This is usually not acceptable as requests to repaint the screen, other button presses etc. will be ignored. The solution is to create a new thread and run Soar in that thread. Now that Soar is running on a separate thread, when the user presses a \"stop\" button if you try to call Stop on the kernel from the UI thread it'll block. What you need to do instead is set a flag within the thread that is running Soar and use an event to check whether that flag has been set and if so call Stop then. The <code>smlEVENT_INTERRUPT_CHECK</code> event is a good candidate for this as it fires infrequently and generates little overhead.</p> <p>Similarly, as the environment changes you'll want to update the input link in the thread that is running Soar.</p> <p>The normal way to do this is again inside an event handler. The update family of events (<code>smlEVENT_AFTER_ALL_OUTPUT_PHASES</code> and <code>smlEVENT_AFTER_ALL_GENERATED_OUTPUT</code>) are good candidates to consider.</p> <p>If all of this seems a bit confusing, take a look at the Java Towers of Hanoi example that's included in the release. It demonstrates all of this behavior and is a good model to follow. If you're working on a command line application without a GUI, then the TestCommandLine application is a good reference as it demonstrates how to support interruption in a single-threaded application.</p> <p>A detailed explanation about threads in Soar is provided here.</p>","tags":["Java","C++","agent development","sml","kernel programming"]},{"location":"development/SoarTechnicalFAQ/#how-do-i-properly-manage-memory-in-my-sml-application","title":"How do I properly manage memory in my SML application?","text":"<p>Memory management is actually really easy. Generally, the only objects you should explicitly delete are the kernel object and any objects you directly allocated through a call to new. In Java and Tcl, this generally means you can just let things go out of scope when you\u2019re done with them. There are a couple special cases you should be aware of, though: Agent objects are automatically deleted when the owning Kernel object is deleted (actually, when the call to <code>Kernel::Shutdown</code> is made, which you should always make before deleting the kernel). If you want to destroy an agent earlier, you can by making a call to <code>Kernel:destroyAgent</code>. Under no circumstances should you delete (in the C++ sense) an Agent object.</p> <p>In Java if you create a <code>ClientXML</code> object through <code>xml = new ClientXML()</code> you should call <code>xml.delete()</code> on it when you're done. This isn't strictly required (the garbage collector will get it eventually) but is good practice and will avoid messages about leaked memory when the application shuts down. As per the general rule, in C++ if you create it with new you\u2019re responsible for destroying it with delete.</p> <p>Since there can be multiple clients interacting with the same kernel and agents, your application needs to be listening for the appropriate events so if some other client deletes/destroys a kernel or agent your application is using, you don\u2019t crash.

The callbacks look very similar from language to language, but some languages have constraints that make a direct conversion of the C++ style impossible. In C++, event callbacks are global functions.</p> <p>In Java, it's not possible to have global functions, so the callback must belong to some class. Thus, for Java we provide an interface for each event type that the class containing the callback method must implement, and then the handling object is passed in as part of the registration. You can look at any of the example Java code to see examples of this (e.g. TestJavaSML or JavaTOH are good places to start).</p> <p>Another important difference is that in C++ and Tcl, the kernel object must be explicitly deleted after <code>Shutdown()</code>.

This file should be in SoarSuite/bin orSoarSuite/out. When you run your program, you have to make sure the Java virtual machine can locate this library as well as the Soar shared library. This is explained in BuildLibrarySearchPaths.</p> <p>After you set the library path correctly, you can run HelloWorld.class using the JVM. When you run the program, sml.jar should also be in the class path. Assuming HelloWorld.class is in the current directory, the command to run the program is:</p> <pre><code>java -cp /home/user/SoarSuite/bin/java/sml.jar:. HelloWorld (for Linux/OSX)\njava -cp C:\\SoarSuite\\bin\\java\\sml.jar;. HelloWorld (for Windows)\n</code></pre> <p>You should see \"Hello World\" printed to the console.

In 8.6. and later, the header file was separated by function into many smaller files which can be found in \"Core/SoarKernel/include\".</p> <p>The <code>agent_struct</code> defined in agent.h includes all the system parameters, counters, variables, and pointers to all the other structures used by an agent (WMEs, productions, hash tables, memory_pools, formats, etc etc).

CLI often refers to the actual object instance (a member of KernelSML) but sometimes can refer to the whole component.</p> <p>The CLI takes an arbitrary string and transforms it into method calls providing a general interface to Soar as described by the help document on the Soar wiki (on Google Code).</p> <p>A command line in this context can actually be many commands, or an entire file. In this document it will be called a command line. The syntax of what is legal closely follows the Tcl language and is spelled out in the Doxygen help in Core/shared/tokenizer.h. These rules are reprinted below.</p> <p>The command line enters the CLI at CommandLineInterface:: DoCommand. Some quick state is updated but then it is passed to Source (defined in cli_source.cpp), a same function used by the source command in Soar. This is why command lines and files are interchangeable.</p> <p>Source then uses the tokenizer utility to split out the command name and its arguments. The critical piece used by tokenizer to do this is the parser instance (cli::Parser, cli_Parser.h, a member of CLI) which knows what all the commands and aliases are.</p> <p>The parser expands aliases, performs a partial match if necessary and then, if there is no ambiguity, calls the appropriate command's Parse function with a vector of the tokens used for the command. Sometimes this vector is only of length 1 (the command name). Again, Tcl rules are used to tokenize each command (and to split commands).</p> <p>These commands' parse methods are defined in cli_Commands.h and registered with the parser with the CLI is first created. The parser is also aware of aliases, which are initially defined in the Aliases constructor executed when the parser is first created. Aliases can change down the road when commands access the parser's aliases member.</p> <p>The purpose of the parse function is to process the command's options (if any) and report syntax errors as necessary. Some input checking is done here but most is saved for the next step (below). Few commands (such as dirs) have no parsing--most have plenty of stuff to do in this phase. No actual processing should happen here, the functions called as a result of parsing should be able to be called directly elsewhere for the same effect without parsing. Example of a command that takes no arguments:</p> <pre><code>dirs\n</code></pre> <p>Some commands just need to test for the presence of and get an argument or two off of the command line before proceeding. An example of this is the max-elaborations command. These commands are simple - the vector of tokens can be inspected and used directly.</p> <p>Example of command that has arguments:</p> <pre><code>max-elaborations 15\nNon-option argument: 15\n</code></pre> <p>Other commands have options which are handled using the option utilities on the Parser instance, sometimes in addition to other, non-option arguments.</p> <p>More common commands (with options):</p> <ul> <li>echo-commands -y</li> <li>Option (short): y</li> <li>learn --off</li> <li>Option (long): off</li> <li>echo -n Hello world!</li> <li>Option (short): n</li> <li>Arguments: Hello, world!</li> <li>watch --chunks -L print</li> <li>Option (long): chunks</li> <li>Option (short) with argument: L, print</li> <li>Options always have both long and short forms, and a required argument,   optional argument, or no argument setting expected. These are all defined in the   top of the Parse function before the option handling code is called.</li> </ul> <p>Once the command and options are parsed, a function call is made to actually process the command. These are all declared initially on the Cli-interface defined in cli_Cli.h. This interface exists to facilitate context-free testing of the command parsing. By convention, these processing functions all start with Do so they are easily spotted on the CLI.</p> <p>The CLI implements this interface, and defines the functions and their related helper functions in their own files. DoSource, for example, is defined in cli_source.cpp.</p> <p>The meat of the command happens in these Do functions. The function signatures vary depending on what the commands need. Enumerations are used to pass modes from the parsing step to the Do step. Null pointers are used often when some parameter is optional, to indicate that it was omitted. Bit vectors are often used to pass a number of flags from the parsing step to the processing step.</p> <p>The motivation behind splitting the parsing from the processing in the commands is both for testing and so that other parts of Soar/SML can call-these interface functions directly without having to render command lines.</p> <p>When commands complete, they return text to be printed after they execute. Traditionally, little or nothing is printed when there is success.</p> <p>There is support for more structured output for commands so that callers can pull specific values out of command results (instead of parsing the stringified results). This mode is optional (skip doing this until you know you need it) and is tested by checking the m_RawOutput member on the CLI.

Different commands interpret their words differently.</p> <p>[3] Words of a command are separated by white space (except for newlines, which are command separators).</p> <p>[4] If the first character of a word is double-quote (\") then the word is terminated by the next double-quote character. If semi-colons, close brackets, or white space characters (including newlines) appear between the quotes then they are treated as ordinary characters and included in the word. Backslash substitution [but not command substitution or variable substitution] is performed on the characters between the quotes as described below. The double-quotes are not retained as part of the word.</p> <p>[5] If the first character of a word is an open brace ({) then the word is terminated by the matching close brace (}). Braces nest within the word: for each additional open brace there must be an additional close brace (however, if an open brace or close brace within the word is quoted with a backslash then it is not counted in locating the matching close brace). No substitutions are performed on the characters between the braces except for backslash-newline substitutions described below, nor do semi-colons, newlines, close brackets, or white space receive any special interpretation. The word will consist of exactly the characters between the outer braces, not including the braces themselves.</p> <p>[6] [Square brackets are not special in this parser. No command substitution.]</p> <p>[7] [Dollar signs are not special in this parser. No variable substitution.]</p> <p>[8] If a backslash <code>\\</code> appears within a word then backslash substitution occurs. In all cases but those described below the backslash is dropped and the following character is treated as an ordinary character and included in the word. This allows characters such as double quotes, and close brackets [and dollar signs but they aren't special characters in this parser] to be included in words without triggering special processing. The following table lists the backslash sequences that are handled specially, along with the value that replaces each sequence.</p> <ul> <li><code>\\a</code> Audible alert (bell) (0x7).</li> <li><code>\\b</code> Backspace (0x8).</li> <li><code>\\f</code> Form feed (0xc).</li> <li><code>\\n</code> Newline (0xa).</li> <li><code>\\r</code> Carriage-return (0xd).</li> <li><code>\\t</code> Tab (0x9).</li> <li><code>\\v</code> Vertical tab (0xb).</li> <li><code>\\n</code>whiteSpace</li> </ul> <p>A single space character replaces the backslash, newline, and all spaces and tabs after the newline. This backslash sequence is unique in that [...] it will be replaced even when it occurs between braces, and the resulting space will be treated as a word separator if it isn't in braces or quotes. \\ Backslash (``\\''). [Not implemented: \\ooo The digits ooo (one, two, or three of them) give the octal value of the character.] [Not implemented: \\xhh The hexadecimal digits hh give the hexadecimal value of the character. Any number of digits may be present.]</p> <p>Backslash substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces, except for backslash-newline as described above.</p> <p>[9] If a hash character (#) appears at a point where Tcl is expecting the first character of the first word of a command, then the hash character and the characters that follow it, up through the next newline, are treated as a comment and ignored. The comment character only has significance when it appears at the beginning of a command.</p> <p>[10] [Talks about details regarding substitution and generally does not apply to this parser.]</p> <p>[11] [Talks about details regarding substitution and generally does not apply to this parser.]</p>","tags":["kernel programming"]},{"location":"development/soar/CLIParsingCode/#parsing","title":"Parsing","text":"<p>The first token of a command is used to find its parser implementation.

When this function is called later, remove_input_wme will decrement the ref count by 1, still leaving it with a non-zero ref count. The way to fix this is to decrement the ref count after we pass the Symbol off to add_input_wme (in effect, we are relinquishing control of the Symbol to the wme):</p> <pre><code>void generate_feeling_frame(agent* thisAgent)\n{\n  // clear previous feeling frame (stored on agent structure)\n  if(thisAgent-&gt;feeling_frame) { remove_input_wme(thisAgent, thisAgent-&gt;feeling_frame); }\n\n  // generate new frame\n  Symbol* frame_att = make_sym_constant(thisAgent, \"frame\");\n  thisAgent-&gt;feeling_frame = add_input_wme(thisAgent, thisAgent-&gt;emotion_header_feeling, frame_att, make_new_identifier(thisAgent, 'F', TOP_GOAL_LEVEL));\n  symbol_remove_ref(thisAgent, frame_att);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Of course, we need to call this function from somewhere.

The CrtSetDbgFlag line says \"report detected leaks when the program exits.\" This is the preferred method -- it is possible to put a similar line at the end of main that says \"report detected leaks now\", but this is subtly different -- objects allocated in the main function may not be deallocated yet, and dlls are not yet unloaded. This can lead to false leak reports. So do it the way I have shown.</p> <p>I will describe the purpose of the commented line in a moment.</p> <p>This is enough to get your test program to report any leaks. The program (and any code you're testing) needs to be compiled in Debug mode for this to work. A leak report will look something like this:</p> <pre><code>Detected memory leaks!\nDumping objects -&gt;\n{19907} normal block at 0x00B24688, 11 bytes long.\nData: &lt;    &lt;#d*1&gt; &gt; 0B 00 00 00 3C 23 64 2A 31 3E 00\n{19906} normal block at 0x00B60360, 104 bytes long.\n Data: &lt;                &gt; 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 CD CD CD CD CD CD CD\n{3840} normal block at 0x00B2B240, 12 bytes long.\n Data: &lt;    desired &gt; 0C 00 00 00 64 65 73 69 72 65 64 00\n{3839} normal block at 0x00B2B198, 104 bytes long.\n Data: &lt;                &gt; 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 02 CD CD CD CD CD CD CD\n{1828} normal block at 0x00AE4BC8, 8 bytes long.\n Data: &lt;H       &gt; 48 02 AF 00 00 00 00 00\n{1699} normal block at 0x00B195C0, 56 bytes long.\n Data: &lt;                &gt; 00 00 00 00 CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD\n{1698} normal block at 0x00B19550, 48 bytes long.\n Data: &lt;@               &gt; 40 CD CD CD CD CD CD CD 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nObject dump complete.\n</code></pre> <p>What this means is that there were 7 leaks in this run. The number in {} is the allocation number of the leaked memory (e.g. {1698} means the 1698th malloc wasn't freed). The leaks are reported in reverse order for some reason. The Data line can sometimes give you a clue as to what is leaking. But the key is the number in the {}. In the code you added at the beginning of main, change the number in the commented line to one of the leak numbers (e.g. 1698 in the above report) and uncomment the line. I recommend doing this in the order in which the leaks occur (i.e. start at the bottom of the list), because some leaks can cause others or appear many times, so if you fix them in order some of the later ones may go away.</p> <p>Now run the program again. The code will break on the allocation number you specified (I recommend running the code from within Visual Studio as this will make bringing up the line of code easier). It is very important that this run be exactly like the previous run so that the same allocations occur in the same order. Otherwise the code will break on some irrelevant allocation. This means removing any randomness in the code execution. For multithreaded code this can be a pain, so I recommend coming up with the simplest possible test case that reproduces the leak you're working on. Sometimes the leak number will change over time because of threading issues, but will remain the same for a while. So it's important to regenerate the report periodically to make sure the allocation number you're working with is still accurate.</p> <p>When the code breaks, it will probably dump you in a low-level system file like dgbheap.c where the actual malloc is taking place. This is probably not interesting to you.

Often, these functions return a pointer that is not saved, and thus cannot be released when it goes away or the agent is destroyed (much of the memory cleanup occurs in destroy_soar_agent).</p> <p>When working with Soar kernel code, some of the leak locations can be confusing. For example, if a hashtable is leaking, the reported leak may not occur where the hashtable was originally allocated, but rather where the hashtable was last resized. This kind of leak can appear to move around depending on what Soar code is run, because some code will require more allocations than others, but only the last one leaks. A similar thing can happen with memory pools (BTW, I believe all hashtable and memory pool leaks have been fixed now).</p> <p>It's also very common for symbols to leak.

The kernel side threading is relatively simple. The kernel is either run in the client's thread or in its own separate thread. This choice is made by the client when it initializes the Soar kernel by calling either <code>Kernel::CreateKernelInCurrentThread()</code> or <code>Kernel::CreateKernelInNewThread()</code>. A remote connection (<code>Kernel::CreateRemoteConnection()</code>) doesn't affect the way the kernel is run; this is determined by the local client that created the kernel initially. If the kernel is running in its own thread, I will name this thread the Kernel Thread.</p> <p>The client side is potentially more complex. First, the client application may inherently be multi-threaded, such as a Java GUI app or it may be a simple single-threaded C++ program (e.g. a command line utility). Second, the calls to start Soar running (e.g. <code>RunAllAgentsForever</code>) block, so many clients will choose to execute this call in a separate thread in order to keep the rest of the application responsive. I'll call this the Run Thread, which means the thread where the run call is initiated. Finally, SML itself starts up (by default) a thread called the Event Thread. This thread is intended to keep the client responsive without a lot of work by the application developer.</p> <p>This gives us a picture of the overall set of threads:</p> Runs in Description Kernel Thread Kernel Keeps the kernel responsive to external commands (i.e. ones coming in over a socket connection). Event Thread Client SML Used to service incoming events sent by the kernel if Soar is not running (i.e. productions are not firing). This thread is optional but is created by default. Run Thread Client Point that run commands are executed. This thread is created by the client, either explicitly with a new thread or implicitly by calling run from the client's main thread.

Let me explain why that is more fully.</p>","tags":["sml","threads","architecture"]},{"location":"development/soar/ThreadsInSML/#why-have-a-kernel-thread","title":"Why Have a Kernel Thread?","text":"<p>With Soar 9.6, a single Soar kernel can have multiple clients connected to it at once. A common situation is an environment in Java that has a local connection to the kernel itself. A debugger is connected remotely to the kernel and a logging application is also remotely connected. Commands can be sent to the kernel over a socket. The question is, how and when should the kernel check this socket for new commands?</p> <p>In the single-threaded model, the kernel is running in the same thread as the client that created it (in our example, the Java environment). In this case, the client is required to poll the socket periodically to see if new commands have arrived. This is exactly what the method <code>Kernel::CheckForIncomingCommands()</code> does, and clients that call <code>CreateKernelInCurrentThread()</code> are required to call this periodically. But making such periodic calls is often difficult for a client. In the case of the Java app the user would need to start some sort of timer and poll across to the kernel whenever it went off. If they fail to realize that this must be done, then the debugger would fail to function at all, leading to a lot of \"why doesn't the debugger respond\" problems. In other clients, making periodic calls may be really complicated. Simple command line utilities tend to take the form: get command from the user, do some work, print some results, get another command. Writing these would be much more challenging if the client is not allowed to block while getting input from the keyboard.</p> <p>So the result is that we recommend running the kernel in its own thread in most cases. That separate thread checks for new commands coming in from either the socket or the local client. In this model, commands are always run in the kernel's thread. That means that, if the local client calls <code>run</code>, what actually happens is that the <code>run</code> command is placed on a message queue and the kernel thread then pulls the command from that queue and executes it. That's important to understand if you're trying to debug a problem at the kernel level, since the client's function call just adds a message to a queue and you usually need to break the execution at the point that the kernel's thread has picked up the message (e.g. in <code>KernelSML::ProcessCommand()</code>). You won't see the client's triggering call higher up in the call stack at that point because it's in a different thread.</p>","tags":["sml","threads","architecture"]},{"location":"development/soar/ThreadsInSML/#why-have-an-event-thread","title":"Why Have an Event Thread?","text":"<p>When Soar is running, it is constantly generating a stream of events. These events are posted to each client, allowing the client to know what's going on during the course of a run. The Event Thread exists to help clients remain responsive to these incoming events. The first thing to understand about Soar events is that they are synchronous calls. That is to say, the kernel blocks during the call to send each client a message that a particular event has occurred. The kernel only continues executing once that call completes. It may not be immediately obvious that events need to be synchronous (indeed early on we thought they might not be) but in turns out to be useful they must be. For example, consider an agent that wishes to take some action when a new phase starts so it registers for the start phase event. If the call is not synchronous, then by the time the event arrives the kernel may now be at a much later execution point. This would limit clients to knowing what had happened, but not doing things at particular times (and this turns out to be 95% of the actual usage).</p> <p>So given that event calls are synchronous and the kernel blocks waiting for them to complete, how do we ensure that clients are responsive?</p> <ul> <li> <p>In the case where the kernel and the client are running in the same thread   there is really no problem.

But this periodic polling can be   complicated as explained earlier. In fact, the situation is even worse for   the client as it needs to be as fast as possible responding to incoming   events or the entire system's performance will degrade.</p> </li> <li> <p>This is where the EventThread comes in. Its job is to check the socket for new events and make the appropriate callback to the client code. This keeps the client responsive and most people will never stop to wonder how a callback inside one process is being triggered by a kernel running in another process without their doing anything.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>There is however a wrinkle in this behavior. When a run call is made by a client (on what we're calling the RunThread) that call blocks. While it is blocked it is checking for incoming messages and dispatching them, while it waits for the message to indicate that the run has completed to come through. This means that when a run is triggered by a client, callbacks will occur on the RunThread. When that client did not initiate the run (e.g. somebody typed run in the debugger) or when Soar is not running (e.g. during an init-soar event), events are handled by the EventThread. This means that callbacks can be called on different threads at different times.</p>","tags":["sml","threads","architecture"]},{"location":"development/soar/ThreadsInSML/#callback-threading-and-blocking-on-run","title":"Callback Threading and Blocking on Run","text":"<p>Let's discuss that a little more. First of all, having the calls come back on different threads isn't ideal. It means a client developer could have different bugs that occur when Soar is run from the client or when Soar is run remotely because the threading is different. In practice, this hasn't really been an issue. On a larger front though it suggests maybe the run calls should not in fact block. If the run calls did not block, the client's life would be easier (they wouldn't need to create a thread when they started a run) and all callbacks would come in on the event thread. The fact that run does block is largely an artifact of how we used to design environments. The main run loop used to look something like:</p> <pre><code>while (!stopped)\n{\n    Run-agents-1-step()\n    Update-world()\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With this model we really want the run call to block so that each single step was a single call (writing this where <code>Run-agents-1-step</code> is non-blocking would be much harder).

The approach we've taken is to assume that the kernel is itself not thread-safe at all. E.g., we'll assume it's not safe to remove a production at the same time a preference is being created as the result of another production firing. Therefore, the approach is to only allow a single command to execute in the kernel at a time.</p> <p>In practical terms, this means even if multiple clients are connected through remote connections their commands are queued up, together with the commands that come from the local connection and executed one at a time. The code for this is in ReceiverThread.cpp. This ensures that the kernel side only executes one command at a time.</p> <p>We also assume that the messaging code is not necessarily thread safe, so we have the client block from sending two messages at the same time. This is achieved with the <code>m_ClientMutex</code> mutex object defined in the Connection class. This decision has a couple of implications.</p> <p>First, it allows the EventThread and the RunThread in the client to live in harmony. A run call will wait for the current event to be processed before it starts and once the run has begun, this lock forces the EventThread to wait for the run to complete. As a result, all events during a run (started by that client) come back on the RunThread and all events outside of a run come back on the EventThread.</p> <p>Second, the presence of a lock on the client makes interruption a bit tricky. If a client issues a stop command from a different thread than the RunThread, it will block, waiting for the run to complete. This is not very helpful. The solution is to have the client issue the stop in an event handler callback, as that callback will always occur on the RunThread if the client is currently running Soar. (If you really want to follow the different cases, the callback might be called by the EventThread but only if the client has not called run, in which case the stop call will go through because the RunThread will not be holding the lock or at least not holding it for a long time).</p> <p>You might wonder, given this model how does the debugger print out state information during a run (e.g. after every 5 decisions). The answer is that it does the work in a callback so the print commands execute on the same thread as the original run command.</p> <p>So while we do not support multiple commands being executed simultaneously (where a second command starts up at an arbitrary time during the first command), we do support multiple commands being executed in a stack (or with reentrancy) where one command is partially complete (such as a run) and another command is executed in the middle of the first command. The keys to this are that the run is paused while this happens (it's in an event handler to be more precise) and the second command executes at a known time (inside an event handler) so the state of the system is well defined. We often end up with large sequences of calls going back and forth inside an initial trigger (init-soar is famous for this) as one action triggers an event, which triggers another action and so on.

When the compile\nflag NO_TIMING_STUFF is not set, statistics will be now be collected on the\ntotal cpu time, total kernel time, time spent in the individual phases of a\ndecision cycle, time spent executing the input and output functions, and time\nspent executing callbacks (or monitors).  When the DETAILED_TIMING_STATS flag\nis set, additional statistics will be collected for ownership, match, and\nchunking computations according to the phase in which they occur. (Notice\nthat DETAILED_TIMING_STATS can only be collected when NO_TIMING_STUFF is not\ntrue.)\n\nThe total_cpu_time is turned on when one of the run_&lt;x&gt; functions is\ninitiated.  This timer is not turned off while the do_one_top_level_phase()\nfunction is executing.  The total_kernel_time timer is turned on just after\nthe total_cpu_time timer and turned off just before the other is turned off.\nThis guarantees that the total kernel time -- including the time it takes to\nturn on and off the kernel timer -- is a part of the total cpu time.  The\ntotal_kernel_time is also turned off whenever a callback is initiated or when\nthe input and output functions are executing.\n\nThe decision_cycle_phase_timers measure the kernel time for each phase of the\ndecision cycle (ie, INPUT_PHASE, PREFERENCE_PHASE, WM_PHASE, OUTPUT_PHASE,\nand DECISION_PHASE).  Each is turned on at the beginning of its corresponding\nphase in do_one_top_level_phase and turned off at the end of that phase.\nThese timers are also turned off for callbacks and during the execution of\nthe input and output functions.\n\nThe monitors_cpu_time timers are also indexed by the current phase.  Whenever\na callback is initiated, both the total_kernel_time and\ndecision_cycle_phase_timer for the current phase are turned off and the\nmonitors_cpu_time turned on.  After the callback has terminated, the kernel\ntimers are turned back on.  Notice that the same relationship holds here as\nit did between the total_cpu_time and total_kernel_time timers.  The\ntotal_kernel_time is always turned off last and turned on first, in\ncomparison to the decision_cycle_phase_timer.  This means that turning the\ndecision_cycle_phase_timers on and off is included as part of the kernel time\nand helps ensure that the total_kernel_time is always greater than the sum of\nthe decision_cycle_timers.\n\nThe input_function_cpu_time and output_function_cpu_time timers measure the\ntime it takes to execute the input and output functions respectively.  Both\nthe total_kernel_time and decision_cycle_phase_timers are turned off when\nthese timers are turned on (with the same ordering as discussed previously).\nThe input function is a little tricky.  Because add-wme can be called by the\ninput routine, which then calls do_buffered_wm_and_ownership_changes, we\ncan't just turn off the kernel timers for input and expect to get numbers for\nboth match_time (see next para) and kernel time.  The solution implemented in\nthe 28.07.96 changes is to not turn off the kernel timers until the actual\nINPUT_PHASE_CALLBACK is initiated.  This takes care of all but direct\nadditions and removals of WMEs.  Since these are done through the add-wme and\nremove-wme commands, the input_timer is turned off there was well, and the\nkernel timers turned back on (for the buffered wm changes).  However, this is\na hack and may introduce problems when add-wme and remove-wme are used at the\ncommand line or someplace in the decision cycle other than input (probably\nrare but possible).\n\nThe DETAILED_TIMING_STATS flag enables collection of statistics on match,\nownership and chunking calculations performed in each part of the decision\ncycle.  An 'other' value is reported which is simply the difference between\nthe sum of the detailed timers and the kernel timer for some phase.  The other\nvalue should always be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nThe \"stats\" command (in soarCommandUtils) has been updated to report these\nnew timing values.  The output is provided in a spreadsheet-style format to\ndisplay the information in a succinct form.  There are also some derived\ntotals in that report.  The derived totals in the right column are simply the\nsum of the all the other columns in a particular row; for example, the\nderived total for the first row, kernel time, is just the sum of all the\ndecision_cycle_phase_timers.  The derived totals in the bottom row are the\nsum of all the basic timers in that row (i.e., no DETAILED statistics are\nincluded in the sum).  For example, the derived total under input is equal to\nthe sum of decision_cycle_phase_timer and the monitors_time for the\nINPUT_PHASE, and the input_function_cpu_time and represents the total time\nspent in the input phase for the current run.  The number in the lower\nright-hand corner is the sum of the derived totals above it in that right\ncolumn (and should always be equal to the numbers to the left of it in that\nrow).\n\nAlso reported with the stats command are the values of total_cpu_time and\ntotal_kernel_time.  If the ordering discussed above is strictly enforced,\ntotal_kernel_time should always be slightly greater than the derived total\nkernel time and total_cpu_time greater than the derived total CPU time.

It does not use any math functions. As currently formulated, it uses a table of all single digit addition facts (for addition and one subtraction strategy) and tables of simple subtraction facts and addition by ten to single digits (for a second subtraction strategy). These facts can be converted to a semantic memory access (in the application of compute-result).</p> <p>Each primitive operator is relatively simple: without complex proposal conditions, control rules, lots of control flags or complex conditional operator applications. The actual execution trace is sometimes a bit tricky, especially for subtraction.</p> <p>The project supports the automatic generation of random 3 column addition and subtraction problems which are created in generate-problem. The project will execute N of these (set as the value of <code>^count</code> in <code>initialize-arithmetic</code>).</p> <p>The project checks that all answers are computed correctly by using Soar's math functions (computed in elaborations/Verify and finish-problem) if an incorrect answer is computed, it is printed out and Soar halts</p> <p>The two subtraction strategies differ in what initial facts they assume. One of the subtraction strategies assumes the same knowledge as addition (the sum of two single digit numbers and the resulting carry), but involves remapping that knowledge so that it is appropriate for subtraction.

For example, in the second strategy, if a larger number is being subtracted from a smaller number, there is an operator no-change impasse because no fact is available for that situation. This is the standard american approach to subtraction. The key rules for this are in process-column/compute-result.soar</p> <p>The only differences between the two strategies are the available facts and a single rule in process-column that applies the process-column operator by accessing the facts (<code>process-column*apply*compute-result*subtraction</code>).

The first player begins bidding, picking a quantity of a face number. The quantity states the player's opinion on how many of the chosen face have been rolled in total on the table.</li> <li>Each player has two choices during his turn: make a higher bid, or challenge the previous bid as being wrong. Raising the bid means either increasing the quantity, or the face value, or both, according to the specific bidding rules used.</li> <li>The 1s (\"aces\") are wild and count as two in a bid, for example to outbid a bid of 2 one's, you must bid at least 5 of a non-wild face.</li> <li>If the current player thinks the previous player's bid is wrong, he challenges it, and then all dice are revealed to determine whether the bid was valid.

Researchers all over the world, both from the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, are using Soar for a variety of tasks. It has been in use since 1983, evolving through many different versions to where it is now Soar, Version 9.</p> <p>We intend ultimately to enable the Soar architecture to:</p> <ul> <li>work on the full range of tasks expected of an intelligent agent, from highly   routine to extremely difficult, open-ended problems</li> <li>represent and use appropriate forms of knowledge, such as procedural,   semantic, episodic, and iconic</li> <li>employ the full range of problem solving methods</li> <li>interact with the outside world, and</li> <li>learn about all aspects of the tasks and its performance on them.</li> </ul> <p>In other words, our intention is for Soar to support all the capabilities required of a general intelligent agent.</p> <p>The ultimate in intelligence would be complete rationality which would imply the ability to use all available knowledge for every task that the system encounters. Unfortunately, the complexity of retrieving relevant knowledge puts this goal out of reach as the body of knowledge increases, the tasks are made more diverse, and the requirements in system response time more stringent. The best that can be obtained currently is an approximation of complete rationality. The design of Soar can be seen as an investigation of one such approximation. Below is the primary principle which is the basis of Soar's design and which guides its attempt to approximate rational behavior.</p> <p>All decisions are made through the combination of relevant knowledge at run-time. In Soar, every decision is based on the current interpretation of sensory data, the contents of working memory created by prior problem solving, and any relevant knowledge retrieved from long-term memory. Decisions are never precompiled into uninterruptible sequences. For many years, a secondary principle has been that the number of distinct architectural mechanisms should be minimized. Through Soar 8, there has been a single framework for all tasks and subtasks (problem spaces), a single representation of permanent knowledge (productions), a single representation of temporary knowledge (objects with attributes and values), a single mechanism for generating goals (automatic subgoaling), and a single learning mechanism (chunking). We have revisited this assumption as we attempt to ensure that all available knowledge can be captured at runtime without disrupting task performance. This is leading to multiple learning mechanisms (chunking, reinforcement learning, episodic learning, and semantic learning), and multiple representations of long-term knowledge (productions for procedural knowledge, semantic memory, and episodic memory).</p> <p>Two additional principles that guide the design of Soar are functionality and performance. Functionality involves ensuring that Soar has all of the primitive capabilities necessary to realize the complete suite of cognitive capabilities used by humans, including, but not limited to reactive decision making, situational awareness, deliberate reasoning and comprehension, planning, and all forms of learning. Performance involves ensuring that there are computationally efficient algorithms for performing the primitive operations in Soar, from retrieving knowledge from long-term memories, to making decisions, to acquiring and storing new knowledge.</p> <p>For further background on Soar, we recommend Introduction to Soar at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03854 and The Soar Cognitive Architecture Laird, J.  E.(2012), The Soar Papers: Readings on Integrated Intelligence, Rosenbloom, Laird, and Newell (1993), and Unified Theories of Cognition, Newell (1990). Also available are Soar: A Functional Approach to General Intelligence and Soar: A comparison with Rule-Based Systems. There is also a full list of publications available. Entries on the Soar Knowledge Base and the older  Soar FAQ also provide answers to many common questions about Soar.</p> <p>We would like to extend a special thank you to DARPA, ONR and AFOSR for their continued support of Soar and projects related to Soar.</p>"},{"location":"home/CommercialSoarOrganizations/","title":"Commercial Soar Organizations","text":"","tags":["organizations"]},{"location":"home/CommercialSoarOrganizations/#commercial-organizations-using-soar","title":"Commercial Organizations Using Soar","text":"","tags":["organizations"]},{"location":"home/CommercialSoarOrganizations/#soar-technology-inc","title":"Soar Technology, Inc.","text":"<p>Soar Technology Inc. is utilizing advanced artificial intelligence, grounded in scientific principles of human-system interaction and implemented through sound software engineering, SoarTech develops intelligent autonomous agent software for modeling and simulation, command and control, information visualization, robotics, and intelligence analysis, for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, DARPA, JFCOM, DMSO and the intelligence community.</p>","tags":["organizations"]},{"location":"home/CommercialSoarOrganizations/#cogniteam-ltd","title":"Cogniteam, Ltd.","text":"<p>Cogniteam is an Israeli company offering project development, consulting, and professional services in AI and robotics in general, and using Soar in particular.

Much of the work is done external to Soar while honoring architectural requirements of Soar. Recent projects include: a survey of forgetting mechanisms, using memories to build plans, using sequences of episodes to overcome state aliasing and using experience to discover the relative importance of various WMEs that comprise an agent's episodes. Many of the insights from this research have been embodied in an advanced episodic memory system called Ziggurat. Throughout this process, the hardest part of creating an effective episodic memory system remains the same: creating an effective, domain-independent algorithm to select the best memory from a given cue.</p> <p>Pace University: An Intelligent Soar Assistant for a Virtual World Abe Guerra has built an assistant for IBM's virtual world.

When <code>learning</code> is set to <code>off</code>, no new episodes are encoded and no commands put on the epmem link are processed. This is the same as using the enable and disable commands.</p> <p>The <code>phase</code> parameter determines which decision cycle phase episode encoding and retrieval will be performed.</p> <p>The <code>trigger</code> parameter controls when new episodes will be encoded. When it is set to <code>output</code>, new episodes will be encoded only if the agent made modifications to the output-link during that decision cycle. When set to 'dc', new episodes will be encoded every decision cycle.</p> <p>The <code>exclusions</code> parameter can be used to prevent episodic memory from encoding parts of working memory into new episodes. The value of <code>exclusions</code> is a list of string constants. During encoding, episodic memory will walk working memory starting from the top state identifier. If it encounters a WME whose attribute is a member of the <code>exclusions</code> list, episodic memory will ignore that WME and abort walking the children of that WME, and they will not be included in the encoded episode. Note that if the children of the excluded WME can be reached from top state via an alternative non-excluded path, they will still be included in the encoded episode. The <code>exclusions</code> parameter behaves differently from other parameters in that issuing <code>epmem --set exclusions &lt;val&gt;</code> does not set its value to <code>&lt;val&gt;</code>. Instead, it will toggle the membership of <code>&lt;val&gt;</code> in the <code>exclusions</code> list.</p> <p>The <code>path</code> parameter specifies the file system path the database is stored in. When <code>path</code> is set to a valid file system path and database mode is set to file, then the SQLite database is written to that path.</p> <p>The append parameter will determine whether all existing episodes recorded in a database on disk will be erased when epmem loads it. Note that this affects episodic memory re-initialization also, i.e. if the append setting is off, all episodic memories stored to disk will be lost when an init-soar is performed. Note that episodic memory cannot currently append to an in-memory database. If you perform an init-soar while using an in-memory database, all current episodes stored will be cleared.</p> <p>Note that changes to database, path and append will not have an effect until the database is used after an initialization. This happens either shortly after launch (on first use) or after a database initialization command is issued. To switch databases or database storage types after running, set your new parameters and then perform an <code>epmem --init</code>.</p> <p>The <code>epmem --backup</code> command can be used to make a copy of the current state of the database, whether in memory or on disk. This command will commit all outstanding changes before initiating the copy.</p> <p>When the database is stored to disk, the <code>lazy-commit</code> and <code>optimization</code> parameters control how often cached database changes are written to disk. These parameters trade off safety in the case of a program crash with database performance. When <code>optimization</code> is set to <code>performance</code>, the agent will have an exclusive lock on the database, meaning it cannot be opened concurrently by another SQLite process such as SQLiteMan. The lock can be relinquished by setting the database to memory or another database and issuing init-soar/<code>epmem --init</code> or by shutting down the Soar kernel.</p> <p>The <code>balance</code> parameter sets the linear weight of match cardinality vs. cue activation. As a performance optimization, when the value is 1 (default), activation is not computed. If this value is not 1 (even close, such as 0.99), and working memory activation is enabled, this value will be computed for each leaf WME, which may incur a noticeable cost, depending upon the overall complexity of the retrieval.</p> <p>The <code>graph-match-ordering</code> parameter sets the heuristic by which identifiers are ordered during graph match (assuming <code>graph-match</code> is <code>on</code>). The default, <code>undefined</code>, does not enforce any order and may be sufficient for small cues. For more complex cues, there will be a one-time sorting cost, during each retrieval, if the parameter value is changed. The currently available heuristics are depth-first search (<code>dfs</code>) and most-constrained variable (<code>mcv</code>). It is advised that you attempt these heuristics to improve performance if the <code>query_graph_match</code> timer reveals that graph matching is dominating retrieval time.</p> <p>The <code>merge</code> parameter controls how the augmentations of retrieved long-term identifiers (LTIs) interact with an existing LTI in working memory. If the LTI is not in working memory or has no augmentations in working memory, this parameter has no effect. If the augmentation is in working memory and has augmentations, by default (<code>none</code>), episodic memory will not augment the LTI. If the parameter is set to <code>add</code> then any augmentations that augmented the LTI in a retrieved episode are added to working memory.</p>"},{"location":"reference/cli/cmd_epmem/#statistics","title":"Statistics","text":"<p>Episodic memory tracks statistics over the lifetime of the agent.

Indeed, any syntax that is allowed in sp is also allowed in gp.</p> <p>Patterns in gp are specified with sets of whitespace-seprated values in square brackets. Every combination of values across all square-bracketed value lists will be generated. Values with whitespaces can be used if wrapped in pipes. Characters can also be escaped with a backslash (so string literals with embedded pipes and spaces outside of string literals are both possible).</p> <p>gp is primarily intended as an alternative to <code>:template</code> rules for reinforcement learning. <code>:template</code> rules generate new rules as patterns occur at run time. Unfortunately, this incurs a high run time cost. If all possible values are known in advance, then the rules can be generated using gp at source time, thus allowing code to run faster. gp is not appropriate when all possible values are not known or if the total number of possible rules is very large (and the system is likely to encounter only a small subset at run time). It is also possible to combine gp and <code>:template</code> (e.g., if some of the values are known and not others).

It based on the work in Richard S. Sutton's paper \"Adapting Bias by Gradient Descent: An Incremental Version of Delta-Bar-Delta\", available online at http://incompleteideas.net/papers/sutton-92a.pdf. Delta Bar Delta (DBD) is implemented in Soar RL as a decay mode. It changes the way all the rules in the eligibility trace get their values updated. In order to implement this, the agent gets an additional learning parameter <code>meta-learning-rate</code> and each rule gets two additional decay parameters: beta and h. The meta learning rate is set manually; the per-rule features are handled automatically by the DBD algorithm. The key idea is that the meta parameters keep track of how much a rule's RL value has been updated recently, and if a rule gets updates in the same direction multiple times in a row then subsequent updates in the same direction will have more effect. So DBD acts sort of like momentum for the learning rate.</p> <p>To enable DBD, use <code>rl --set decay-mode delta-bar-delta</code>. To change the meta learning rate, use e.g. <code>rl --set meta-learning-rate 0.1</code>. When you execute <code>rl</code>, under the \"Experimental\" section of output you'll see the current settings for <code>decay-mode</code> and <code>meta-learning-rate</code>. Also, if a rule gets printed concisely (e.g. by executing <code>p</code>), and the rule is an RL rule, and the decay mode is set to delta-bar-delta, then instead of printing the rule name followed by the update count and the RL value, it will print the rule name, beta, h, update count, and RL value.</p> <p>Note that DBD is a different feature than <code>meta</code>. Meta determines whether metadata about a production is stored in its header string. If meta is on and DBD is on, then each rule's beta and h values will be stored in the header string in addition to the update count, so you can print out the rule, source it later and that metadata about the rule will still be in place.</p>"},{"location":"reference/cli/cmd_rl/#rl-gq","title":"RL GQ","text":"<p>Linear GQ(\\(\\lambda\\)) is a gradient-based off-policy temporal-difference learning algorithm, as developed by Hamid Maei and described by Adam White and Rich Sutton (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03967.pdf).

Kernel time is the time spent in core Soar functions. In this case, kernel time is defined as the all functions other than the execution of callbacks and the input and output functions. The total kernel timer is only stopped for these functions. The phase timers (for the kernel and callbacks) track the execution time for individual phases of the decision cycle (i.e., input phase, preference phase, working memory phase, output phase, and decision phase). Because there is overhead associated with turning these timers on and off, the actual kernel time will always be greater than the derived kernel time (i.e., the sum of all the phase kernel timers). Similarly, the total CPU time will always be greater than the derived total (the sum of the other timers) because the overhead of turning these timers on and off is included in the total CPU time. In general, the times reported by the single timers should always be greater than than the corresponding derived time. Additionally, as execution time increases, the difference between these two values will also increase.

The size of the cache is based upon three run-time parameters (<code>decay-rate</code>, <code>decay-thresh</code>, and <code>max-pow-cache</code>), and one compile time parameter, <code>WMA_REFERENCES_PER_DECISION</code> (default value of 50), which estimates the maximum number of times a WME will be referenced during a decision.

However, small changes to <code>decay-rate</code> will dramatically change this profile. For instance, keeping everything else constant, a <code>decay-thresh</code> of 0.3 requires ~2.7GB and 0.2 requires ~50TB. Thus, the <code>max-pow-cache</code> parameter serves to allow you to control the space vs. time tradeoff by capping the maximum amount of memory used by this cache.

Classically    Soar had only a single representation of permanent knowledge (production rules), a    single representation of temporary knowledge (objects with attributes and values), a    single mechanism for generating goals (automatic subgoaling), and a single learning    mechanism (chunking). It was only as Soar was applied to diverse tasks in complex    environments that we found these mechanisms to be insufficient and added new long-    term memories (semantic and episodic) and learning mechanisms (semantic, episodic,    and reinforcement learning) to extend Soar agents with crucial new functionalities.</li> <li>All decisions are made through the combination of relevant knowledge at run-time.

A state is a representation of the current problem-solving situation; an operator transforms a state (makes changes to the representation); and a goal is a desired outcome of the problem-solving activity.</p> <p>As Soar runs, it is continually trying to apply the current operator and select the next operator (a state can have only one operator at a time), until the goal has been achieved. The selection and application of operators is illustrated in Figure 2.1.</p> Soar is continually trying to select and apply operators. <p>Soar has separate memories (and different representations) for descriptions of its current situation and its long-term procedural knowledge. In Soar, the current situation, including data from sensors, results of intermediate inferences, active goals, and active operators is held in working memory. Working memory is organized as objects. Objects are described in terms of their attributes; the values of the attributes may correspond to sub-objects, so the description of the state can have a hierarchical organization. (This need not be a strict hierarchy; for example, there\u2019s nothing to prevent two objects from being \"substructure\" of each other.)</p> <p>Long-term procedural knowledge is held in production memory.

Indirect changes are used in Soar programs that interact with an external environment: The Soar program sends motor commands to the external environment and monitors the external environment for changes. The changes are reflected in an updated state description, garnered from sensors. Soar may also make direct changes to the state; these correspond to Soar doing problem solving \"in its head\". Soar programs that do not interact with an external environment can make only direct changes to the state.</p> <p>Internal and external problem solving should not be viewed as mutually exclusive activities in Soar. Soar programs that interact with an external environment will generally have operators that make direct and indirect changes to the state: The motor command is represented as substructure of the state and it is a command to the environment. Also, a Soar program may maintain an internal model of how it expects an external operator will modify the world; if so, the operator must update the internal model (which is substructure of the state).</p> <p>When Soar is doing internal problem solving, it must know how to modify the state descriptions appropriately when an operator is being applied.

For a specific problem and a particular stage in problem solving, only a subset of all possible operators are actually relevant. For example, if our goal is to count the blocks on the table, operators having to do with moving blocks are probably not important, although they may still be \"legal\". The operators that are relevant to current problem-solving activity define the space of possible states that might be considered in solving a problem, that is, they define the problem space.</p> <p>Soar programs are implicitly organized in terms of problem spaces because the conditions for proposing operators will restrict an operator to be considered only when it is relevant.

Typically, when</p> The problem space in the blocks-world includes all operators that move blocks from one location to another and all possible configurations of the three blocks. <p>Soar solves a problem in this problem space, it does not explicitly generate all of the states, examine them, and then create a path. Instead, Soar isin a specific state at a given time (represented in working memory), attempting to select an operator that will move it to a new state. It uses whatever knowledge it has about selecting operators given the current situation, and if its knowledge is sufficient, it will move toward its goal.</p> <p>The same problem could be recast in Soar as a planning problem, where the goal is to develop a plan to solve the problem, instead of just solving the problem. In that case, a state in Soar would consist of a plan, which in turn would have representations of blocks-world states and operators from the original space. The operators would perform editing operations on the plan, such as adding new blocks-world operators, simulating those operators, etc. In both formulations of the problem, Soar is still applying operators to generate new states, it is just that the states and operators have different content.</p> <p>The remaining sections in this chapter describe the memories and processes of Soar: work- ing memory, production memory, preference memory, Soar\u2019s execution cycle (the decision procedure), learning, and how input and output fit in.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/02_TheSoarArchitecture/#working-memory-the-current-situation","title":"Working memory: The Current Situation","text":"<p>Soar represents the current problem-solving situation in its working memory. Thus, working memory holds the current state and operator and is Soar\u2019s \"short-term\" knowledge, reflecting the current knowledge of the world and the status in problem solving.</p> <p>Working memory contains elements called working memory elements, or WMEs for short. Each WME contains a very specific piece of information; for example, a WME might say that \"B1 is a block\". Several WMEs collectively may provide more information about the same object, for example, \"B1 is a block\", \"B1 is named A\", \"B1 is on the table\", etc. These WMEs are related because they are all contributing to the description of something that is internally known to Soar as \"B1\". B1 is called an identifier; the group of WMEs that share this identifier are referred to as an object in working memory. Each WME describes a different attribute of the object, for example, its name or type or location; each attribute has a value associated with it, for example, the name is A, the type is block, and the position is on the table. Therefore, each WME is an identifier-attribute-value triple, and all WMEs with the same identifier are part of the same object.</p> <p>Objects in working memory are linked to other objects: The value of one WME may be an identifier of another object. For example, a WME might say that \"B1 is on top of T1\", and another collection of WMEs might describe the object T1: \"T1 is a table\", \"T1 is brown\", and \"T1 is on top of F1\". And still another collection of WMEs might describe the object F1: \"F1 is a floor\", etc. All objects in working memory must be linked to a state, either directly or indirectly (through other objects). Objects that are not linked to a state will be automatically removed from working memory by the Soar architecture.</p> <p>WMEs are also often called augmentations because they \"augment\" the object, providing more detail about it. While these two terms are somewhat redundant, WME is a term that is used more often to refer to the contents of working memory (as a single identifier-attribute-value triple), while augmentation is a term that is used more often to refer to the description of an object. Working memory is illustrated at an abstract level in Figure 2.3.</p> <p>The attribute of an augmentation is usually a constant, such as <code>name</code> or <code>type</code>, because in a sense, the attribute is just a label used to distinguish one link in working memory from another.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>The value of an augmentation may be either a constant, such as <code>red</code>, or an identifier, such as 06. When the value is an identifier, it refers to an object in working memory that may have additional substructure. In semantic net terms, if a value is a constant, then it is a terminal node with no links; if it is an identifier it is a non terminal node.</p> <p>One key concept of Soar is that working memory is a set, which means that there can never be two elements in working memory at the same time that have the same identifier-attribute- value triple (this is prevented by the architecture). However, it is possible to have multiple working memory elements that have the same identifier and attribute, but that each have different values. When this happens, we say the attribute is a multi-valued attribute, which is often shortened to be multi-attribute.</p> <p>An object is defined by its augmentations and not by its identifier. An identifier is simply a label or pointer to the object. On subsequent runs of the same Soar program, there may be an object with exactly the same augmentations, but a different identifier, and the program will still reason about the object appropriately. Identifiers are internal markers for Soar; they can appear in working memory, but they never appear in a production.</p> <p>There is no predefined relationship between objects in working memory and \"real objects\" in the outside world. Objects in working memory may refer to real objects, such as block A; features of an object, such as the color red or shape cube; a relation between objects, such as on top; classes of objects, such as blocks; etc. The actual names of attributes and values have no meaning to the Soar architecture (aside from a few WMEs created by the architecture itself). For example, Soar doesn\u2019t care whether the things in the blocks world are called \"blocks\" or \"cubes\" or \"chandeliers\". It is up to the Soar programmer to pick suitable labels and to use them consistently.</p> <p>The elements in working memory arise from one of four sources:</p> <ol> <li>Productions: The actions on the RHS of productions create most working memory    elements.</li> <li>Architecture:<ul> <li>(a) State augmentations: The decision procedure automatically creates some special   state augmentations (type, superstate, impasse, ...) whenever a state is created.

These include the augmentations created when a state is created, and the state\u2019s operator augmentation that signifies the current operator (and is created based on preferences).

These preferences should persist only as long as the production instantiation that created them continues to match. When the production instantiation no longer matches, the situation has changed, making the preference no longer relevant. Soar automatically removes the preferences in such cases. These preferences are said to have i-support (for \"instantiation support\"). Similarly, state elaborations are simple inferences that are valid only so long as the production matches. Working memory elements created as state elaborations also have i-support and remain in working memory only as long as the production instantiation that created them continues to match working memory. For example, the set of relevant operators changes as the state changes, thus the proposal of operators is done with i-supported preferences. This way, the operator proposals will be retracted when they no longer apply to the current situation.</p> <p>However, the actions of productions that apply an operator, either by adding or removing elements from working memory, persist regardless of whether the operator is still selected or the operator application production instantiation still matches. For example, in placing a block on another block, a condition is that the second block be clear. However, the action of placing the first block removes the fact that the second block is clear, so the condition will no longer be satisfied.</p> <p>Thus, operator application productions do not retract their actions, even if they no longer match working memory. This is called o-support (for \"operator support\").

Thus, in the substate, operators will be selected and applied in an attempt either to discover which of the tied operators should be selected, or to apply the selected operator piece by piece. The substate is often called a subgoal because it exists to resolve the impasse, but is sometimes called a substate because the representation of the subgoal in Soar is as a state.</p> <p>The initial state in the subgoal contains a complete description of the cause of the impasse, such as the operators that could not be decided among (or that there were no operators proposed) and the state that the impasse arose in. From the perspective of the new state, the latter is called the <code>superstate</code>. Thus, the <code>superstate</code> is part of the substructure of each state, represented by the Soar architecture using the <code>superstate</code> attribute. (The initial state, created in the 0th decision cycle, contains a <code>superstate</code> attribute with the value of <code>nil</code> - the top-level state has no superstate.)</p> <p>The knowledge to resolve the impasse may be retrieved by any type of problem solving, from searching to discover the implications of different decisions, to asking an outside agent for advice.

(The operators proposed for solving the subgoal may be similar to the operators in the superstate, or they may be entirely different.) While problem solving in the subgoal, additional impasses may be encountered, leading to new subgoals. Thus, it is possible for Soar to have a stack of subgoals, represented as states: Each state has a single superstate (except the initial state) and each state may have at most one substate. Newly created subgoals are considered to be added to the bottom of the stack; the first state is therefore called the top-level state.<sup>3</sup> See Figure 2.11 for a simplified illustrations of a subgoal stack.</p> A simplified illustration of a subgoal stack. <p>Soar continually attempts to retrieve knowledge relevant to all goals in the subgoal stack, although problem-solving activity will tend to focus on the most recently created state.

The results of a subgoal are the working memory elements and preferences that were created in the substate, and that are also linked directly or indirectly to a superstate (any superstate in the stack). A preference or working memory element is said to be created in a state if the production that created it tested that state and this is the most recent state that the production tested. Thus, if a production tests multiple states, the preferences and working memory elements in its actions are considered to be created in the most recent of those states (the lowest-level state) and is not considered to have been created in the other states. The architecture automatically detects if a preference or working memory element created in a substate is also linked to a superstate.</p> <p>These working memory elements and preferences will not be removed when the impasse is resolved because they are still linked to a superstate, and therefore, they are called the results of the subgoal. A result has either i-support or o-support; the determination of support is described below.</p> <p>A working memory element or preference will be a result if its identifier is already linked to a superstate. A working memory element or preference can also become a result indirectly if, after it is created and it is still in working memory or preference memory, its identifier becomes linked to a superstate through the creation of another result. For example, if the problem solving in a state constructs an operator for a superstate, it may wait until the operator structure is complete before creating an <code>acceptable</code> preference for the operator in the superstate. The <code>acceptable</code> preference is a result because it was created in the state and is linked to the superstate (and, through the superstate, is linked to the top-level state).

The impasse is not \"resolved\", and Soar does not learn in this situation.</p> <p>The reason for regeneration is to guarantee that the working memory elements and preferences created in a substate are consistent with higher level states. As stated above, inconsistency can arise when a higher level state changes either as a result of changes in what is sensed in the external environment, or from results produced in the subgoal. The problem with inconsistency is that once inconsistency arises, the problem being solved in the subgoal may no longer be the problem that actually needs to be solved. Luckily, not all changes to a superstate lead to inconsistency.</p> <p>In order to detect inconsistencies, Soar maintains a Goal Dependency Set (GDS) for every subgoal/substate. The dependency set consists of all working memory elements that were tested in the conditions of productions that created o-supported working memory elements that are directly or indirectly linked to the substate (in other words, any superstate knowledge used to derive persistent substate knowledge). Whenever such an o-supported WME is created, Soar records which superstate WMEs were tested, directly or indirectly, to create it.

We can informally think of the way in which Soar falls short as its peculiar \"psychology.\" Those interested in using Soar to model human cognition would like Soar\u2019s psychology to approximate human psychology. Those using Soar to create agent systems would like to make Soar\u2019s processing approximate the knowledge level as closely as possible. Soar 7 had a number of symbol-level quirks that appeared inconsistent with human psychology and that made building large-scale, knowledge-based systems in Soar more difficult than necessary. Bob Wray\u2019s thesis <sup>6</sup> addressed many of these symbol-level problems in Soar, among them logical inconsistency in symbol manipulations, non-contemporaneous constraints in chunks , race conditions in rule firings and in the decision process, and contention between original task knowledge and learned knowledge.</p> <p>The Goal Dependency Set implements a solution to logical inconsistencies between persis- tent (o-supported) WMEs in a substate and its \"context\". The context consists of all the WMEs in any superstates above the local goal/state.<sup>7</sup> In Soar, any action (application) of an operator receives an o-support preference. This preference makes the resulting WME persistent: it will remain in memory until explicitly removed or until its local state is removed, regardless of whether it continues to be justified.</p> <p>Persistent WMEs are pervasive in Soar, because operators are the main unit of problem solving. Persistence is necessary for taking any non-monotonic step in a problem space. However, persistent WMEs also are dependent on WMEs in the superstate context. The problem in Soar prior to GDS, especially when trying to create a large-scale system, is that the knowledge developer must always think about which dependencies can be \"ignored\" and which may affect the persistent WME. For example, imagine an exploration robot that makes a persistent decision to travel to some distant destination based, in part, on its power reserves. Now suppose that the agent notices that its power reserves have failed. If this change is not communicated to the state where the travel decision was made, the agent will continue to act as if its full power reserves were still available.</p> <p>Of course, for this specific example, the knowledge designer can encode some knowledge to react to this inconsistency. The fundamental problem is that the knowledge designer has to consider all possible interactions between all o-supported WMEs and all contexts. Soar systems often use the architecture\u2019s impasse mechanism to realize a form of decomposition.  These potential interactions mean that the knowledge developer cannot focus on individual problem spaces in isolation when creating knowledge, which makes knowledge development more difficult. Further, in all but the simplest systems, the knowledge designer will miss some potential interactions. The result is that agents were unnecessarily brittle, failing in difficult-to-understand, difficult-to-duplicate ways.</p> <p>The GDS also solves the the problem of non-contemporaneous constraints in chunks. A non-contemporaneous constraint refers to two or more conditions that never co-occur simultaneously. An example might be a driving robot that learned a rule that attempted to match \"red light\" and \"green light\" simultaneously. Obviously, for functioning traffic lights, this rule would never fire. By ensuring that local persistent elements are always consistent with the higher-level context, non-contemporaneous constraints in chunks are guaranteed not to happen.</p> <p>The GDS captures context dependencies during processing, meaning the architecture will identify and respond to inconsistencies automatically. The knowledge designer then does not have to consider potential inconsistencies between local, o-supported WMEs and the context.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/02_TheSoarArchitecture/#behavior-level-view-of-the-goal-dependency-set","title":"Behavior-level view of the Goal Dependency Set","text":"<p>The following discussion covers what the GDS does, and how that impacts production knowledge design and implementation.</p> <p>Operation of the Goal Dependency Set: Consider i-support. The persistence of an i-supported (\"instantiation supported\") WME depends upon the creating production instantiation (and, more specifically, the features the instantiation tests). When one of the conditions in the production instantiation no longer matches, the instantiation is retracted, resulting in the loss of that support for the WME. I-support is illustrated in Figure 2.12. A copy of A in the subgoal,As, is retracted automatically when A changes to A\u2019. The substate WME persists only as long as it remains justified by A.</p> <p>In the broadest sense, we can say that some feature <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> is \"dependent\" upon another element <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> if <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> was used in the creation of <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, i.e., if <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> was tested in the production instantiation that created <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>. Further, a dependent change with respect to feature <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> is a change to any of its instantiating features. This applies to both i-supported and o- supported WMEs. In Figure 2.12, the change from A to A\u2019 is a dependent change for feature 1 because A was used to create 1.</p> <p>When A changes, the persistent WME 1 may be no longer consistent with its context (e.g., A\u2019). The specific solution to this problem through GDS is inspired by the dependency analysis portion of the justification/chunking algorithm (see Chapter 4). Whenever an o- supported WME is created in the local state, the superstate dependencies of that new feature are determined and added to the goal dependency set (GDS) of that state. Conceptually speaking, whenever a working memory change occurs, the dependency sets for every state in the context hierarchy are compared to working memory changes. If a removed element is found in a GDS, the state is removed from memory (along with all existing substructure). The dependency set includes only dependencies for o-supported features. For example, in Figure 2.13, at time \\(t_0\\) , because only i-supported features have been created in the subgoal, the dependency set is empty.</p> Simplified Representation of the context dependencies (above the line), local o-supported WMEs (below the line), and the generation of a result. Prior to GDS, this situation led to non-contemporaneous constraints in the chunk that generates 3. The Dependency Set in Soar. <p>Three types of features can be tested in the creation of an o-supported feature. Each requires a slightly different type of update to the dependency set.</p> <ol> <li>Elements in the superstate: WMEs in the superstate are added directly to the    goal\u2019s dependency set. In Figure 2.13, the persistent subgoal item 3 is dependent upon    A and D. These superstate WMEs are added to the subgoal\u2019s dependency set when 3    is added to working memory at time \\(t_1\\). It does not matter that A is i-supported and    Do-supported.</li> <li>Local i-supported features: Local i-supported features are not added to the goal    dependency set. Instead, the superstate WMEs that led to the creation of the i-    supported feature are determined and added to the GDS. In the example, when 4    is created,A, B and C must be added to the dependency set because they are the    superstate features that led to 1 , which in turn led to 2 and finally 4. However, because    item A was previously added to the dependency set at \\(t_1\\) , it is unnecessary to add it    again.</li> <li>Local o-supported features: The dependencies of a local o-supported feature have    already been added to the state\u2019s GDS. Thus, tests of local o-supported WMEs do not    require additions to the dependency set. In Figure 2.13, the creation of element 5 does    not change the dependency set because it is dependent only upon persistent items 3    and 4 , whose features had been previously added to the GDS.</li> </ol> <p>At any time after t 1 , either the D to D\u2019 or A to A\u2019 transition would cause the removal of the entire subgoal. TheEtoE\u2019transition causes no retraction becauseEis not in the goal\u2019s dependency set.</p> <p>The role of the GDS in agent design: The GDS places some design time constraints on operator implementation. These constraints are:</p> <ul> <li>Operator actions that are used to remember a previous state/situation should be asserted in the top state.</li> <li>All operator elaborations should be i-supported.</li> <li>Any operator with local actions should be designed to be re-entrant.</li> </ul> <p>Because any dependencies for o-supported subgoal WMEs will be added to the GDS, the developer must decide if an o-supported element should be represented in a substate or the top state. This decision is straightforward if the functional role of the persistent element is considered. Four important capabilities that require persistence are:</p> <ol> <li>Reasoning hypothetically: Some structures may need to reflect hypothetical states.    These are \"assumptions\" because a hypothetical inference cannot always be grounded    in the current context. In problem solvers with truth maintenance, only assumptions    are persistent.</li> <li>Reasoning non-monotonically: Sometimes the result of an inference changes one    of the structures on which the inference is dependent. As an example, consider the    task of counting. Each newly counted item replaces the old value of the count.</li> <li>Remembering: Agents oftentimes need to remember an external situation or    stimulus, even when that perception is no longer available.</li> <li>Avoiding Expensive Computations: In some situations, an agent may have the    information needed to derive some belief in a new world state but the expense of    performing the necessary computation makes this derivation undesirable. For example,    in dynamic, complex domains, determining when to make an expensive calculation is    often formulated as an explicit agent task.</li> </ol> <p>When remembering or avoiding an expensive computation, the agent/designer is making a commitment to retain something even though it might not be supported in the current context. These WMEs should be asserted in the top state. For many Soar systems, especially those focused on execution in a dynamic environment, most o-supported elements will need to be stored on the top state.</p> <p>For any kind of local, non-monotonic reasoning about the context (counting, projection planning), features should be stored locally. When a dependent context change occurs, the GDS interrupts the processing by removing the state. While this may seem like a severe over-reaction, formal and empirical analysis have suggested that this solution is less computationally expensive than attempting to identify the specific dependent assumption.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/02_TheSoarArchitecture/#footnotes","title":"Footnotes","text":"<ul> <li>[1]: In this blocks-world task, the table always has    room for another block, so it is represented as always being \"clear\".</li> <li>[2]: In order to allow these links to have some    substructure, the attribute name may be an identifier, which means that the    attribute may itself have attributes and values, as specified by additional    working memory elements.</li> <li>[3]:  The original state is the \"top\" of the stack    because as Soar runs, this state (created first), will be at the top of the    computer screen, and substates will appear on the screen below the top-level    state.</li> <li>[4]: Technically, an i-supported WME is only retracted    when it loses instantiation support, not when the creating production is    retracting.

Some Soar systems may benefit from having multiple input and output links, or that use names which are more descriptive of the input or output function, such as <code>vision-input-link</code>, <code>text-input-link</code>, or <code>motor-output-link</code>. In addition to providing the default io substructure, the architecture allows users to create multiple input and output links via productions and I/O functions.

Chunking utilizes Soar\u2019s impasse-driven model of problem decomposition into sub-goals to create new productions dynamically during task execution. These new productions, called chunks, summarize the substate problem-solving that occurred which led to new knowledge in a superstate. Whenever a rule fires and creates such new superstate knowledge, which are called results, Soar learns a new rule and immediately adds it to production memory. In future similar situations, the new chunk will fire and create the appropriate results in a single step, which eliminates the need to spawn another subgoal to perform similar problem-solving. In other words, rather than contemplating and figuring out what to do, the agent immediately knows what to do.</p> <p>Chunking can effect both speed-up and transfer learning. A chunk can effect speed-up learning because it compresses all of the problem-solving needed to produce a result into a single step. For some real-world agents, hundreds of rule firings can be compressed into a single rule firing. A chunk can effect transfer learning because it generalizes the problem-solving in such a way that it can apply to other situations that are similar but have not yet been experienced by the agent.</p> <p>Chunks are created whenever one subgoal creates a result in a superstate; since most Soar programs are continuously sub-goaling and returning results to higher-level states, chunks are typically created continuously as Soar runs.

This allows it to determine what is generalizable and what limits there are on those generalizations. Unfortunately, the information necessary to determine this information was not readily available in prior versions of Soar which only recorded a trace of all WMEs that were tested in the substate. This trace, which we call the working memory trace possesses limited explanatory information, which limited chunking to learning very specific rules in which only Soar identifiers were variablized and all other elements tested the exact values found in the working memory trace.</p> <p>To remedy this limitation and produce more general chunks, EBBS creates and analyzes a behavior trace. Figure below shows an example behavior trace.</p> A close-up of a trace showing differences between a working memory trace (left) and a behavior trace (right). The working memory trace only contains the literal values of the WMEs that matched. The behavior trace, on the other hand, contains variables and various constraints on the values those variables can hold. <p>Note that this trace is generated dynamically as rules match. Whenever a rule matches during agent execution, Soar creates an internal record of the rule that fired, which is called a rule instantiation. (Each box in the behavior traces of this chapter represents an instantiation that was created during task execution within a particular substate.) The instantiation contains both instance information about what matched (the working memory elements) and explanatory information about why they matched (the rules and actions in the original rules that contains variables, constraint tests, RHS actions, etc.).</p> <p>Note that WMEs that were automatically created by the architecture have special instantiations that explain why they were created. For example, an architectural instantiation is created for each <code>^item</code> attribute automatically created in operator tie impasse substates; the explanation causes the <code>^item</code> augmentation to be dependent on the operator in the super-state that led to it, which means that chunks learned which tested that <code>^item</code> augmentation will cause the chunk to also be dependent on the operator in the superstate.</p> <p>Similarly, architectural instantiations are created for structures recalled by semantic and episodic memory in the substate.</p> <p>All of the instantiations that were created in a substate form the instantiation graph of that substate. As chunking backtraces through the instantiation graph, it determines the subset of instantiations that contributed to a result. This set of instantiations and the connections between them is the basis for the behavior trace used for a learning episode. (At this point, the behavior trace is a subgraph of the instantiation graph.)</p> A visualization of the behavior trace of a chunk learned by the arithmetic agent. Each box represents a rule that fired in the substate. Arrows show dependencies between rules that create working memory elements and conditions that test those working memory elements. <p>EBBS also creates an identity graph as it incrementally builds the instantiation graph. Production memory has knowledge about the actual matched value for each element in each condition of a rule in the instantiation graph. Some elements are variables, some are literal constants, some variables are the same as other variables, constraints are placed on some variables. Distributed Identity Graph Unification (DIGU) annotates each element with a pointer that maps it to either a new or existing identity in the identity graph. This annotation is used to determine whether elements in different instantiations refer to the same underlying object and supports identity-based variabilization.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#overview-of-the-ebbs-algorithm","title":"Overview of the EBBS Algorithm","text":"<p>Basic concepts:</p> <ul> <li>Every condition and action in the instantiation graph has three elements:<ul> <li>For conditions, the three elements refer to the symbol in the positive     equality test for the identifier, attribute and value of the condition.

The connection between rule 2 and rule 1 will unify the identities of <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> ,<code>&lt;x&gt;</code> an <code>&lt;y&gt;</code> in rule 1 with the identities of <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> ,<code>&lt;x&gt;</code> an <code>&lt;y2&gt;</code> in rule 2. So, the <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> in rule 2 shares the same identity as the <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> in rule 1. Similarly, the <code>&lt;y2&gt;</code> in rule 2 shares the same identity as <code>&lt;y&gt;</code> in rule 1. In contrast, the <code>&lt;y&gt;</code> in rule 2 does NOT share the same identity as the <code>&lt;y&gt;</code> in rule 1.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter that the <code>&lt;y&gt;</code> in rule 1 uses the same variable name as the<code>&lt;y&gt;</code> in rule 2. It also doesn\u2019t matter that both conditions with <code>&lt;y&gt;</code> happen to match the same working memory element, <code>(S1 ^number 3)</code>. In terms of sharing an identity, the only thing that matters is how the rules interact, namely whether there\u2019s a connection between elements in the condition of one rule and elements in the actions of another rule.</p> <p>Variable identities can also be mapped to the NULL identity, which means that any elements in the final rule that share that identity will not be variablized. When this happens, we say that the identity has been literalized. There are two ways that a rule interaction can effect an identity literalization:</p> <ol> <li>If a RHS action of one rule creates a WME element using a constant, literal     value in an element and a LHS condition tests that element, then the     identity of the condition\u2019s variables is literalized and mapped to the NULL     identity.  Because the variable in the condition matched a rule that will     always create the same constant, literal value, the condition\u2019s variable     must have that same value. Otherwise, it would not have matched.</li> <li>If a RHS action of one rule creates a WME element using a variable and a LHS     condition tests that that element is a specific value, then the identity of the     action\u2019s variables is literalized and mapped to the NULL identity. Because the     condition requires that the rule that created the matched WME to have a specific     constant, literal value, the action\u2019s variable must have that same value.     Otherwise, it would not have created something that matched the condition.</li> </ol> <p>Identities are the basis of nearly every mechanism in EBBS.

Traditionally, the philosophy behind how an agent should be designed was that the path of operator selections and applications from an initial state in a substate to a result would always have all necessary tests in the operator proposal conditions and any goal test, so only those items would need to be summarized. The idea was that in a properly designed agent, a substate's operator evaluation preferences lead to a more efficient search of the space but do not influence the correctness of the result. As a result, the knowledge used by rules that produce such evaluation preferences should not be included in any chunks produced from that substate.</p> <p>In practice, however, it may make sense to design an agent so that search control does affect the correctness of search. Here are just two examples:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Some of the tests for correctness of a result are included in productions     that prefer operators that will produce correct results. The system will work     correctly only when those productions are loaded.</p> </li> <li> <p>An operator is given a worst preference, indicating that it should be used     only when all other options have been exhausted. Because of the semantics of     worst, this operator will be selected after all other operators; however, if     this operator then produces a result that is dependent on the operator     occurring after all others, this fact will not be captured in the conditions     of the chunk.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In both of these cases, part of the test for producing a result is implicit in search control productions. This move allows the explicit state test to be simpler because any state to which the test is applied is guaranteed to satisfy some of the requirements for success. However, chunks created in such a problem space will not be correct because important parts of the superstate that were tested by operator evaluation rules do not appear as conditions. The chunks would not accurately summarize the processing in that problem state. The tracking of Relevant Operator Selection Knowledge (ROSK) is a way to address this issue.</p> <p>Relevant operator selection knowledge is the set of necessary operator evaluation preferences that led to the selection of an operator in a subgoal. As previously described, whenever Soar learns a rule, it recursively backtraces through rule instances to determine which conditions to include in the final chunk or justification. With the ROSK, not only does Soar backtrace through each rule instance that created a matched working memory element, but it also backtraces through every rule instance that created preferences in the ROSK for any operator that gave those matched WMEs o-support. By backtracing through that additional set of preferences at each step of the backtrace, an agent will create more specific chunks that incorporate the goal-attainment knowledge encoded in the operator evaluation rules.</p> <p>Specifically, this component does two things:</p> <ol> <li> <p>When an operator is selected, it analyzes the operator preferences that led     to the decision, and caches any operator selection knowledge that played a     necessary role in the selection.</p> <p>All necessity preferences, i.e. prohibit and require preferences, are always included in the ROSK since they inherently encode the correctness of whether an operator is applicable in a problem space. In contrast, some desirability preferences (rejects, betters, worses, bests, worsts and indifferents) are included in the ROSK depending on the role they play in the selection of the operator.</p> <p>How Soar determines which of those preferences to include in the ROSK is determined by the preference semantics it uses to choose an operator. During the decision phase, operator preferences are evaluated in a sequence of seven steps or filters, in an effort to select a single operator, as described in how preferences are evaluated to decide an operator. Each step, or filter, handles a specific type of preference. As the preference semantics are applied at each step to incrementally filter the candidate operators to a potential selected operator, EBBS incrementally adds operator preferences to the ROSK based on the preferences that were instrumental in applying each filter. A more detailed explanation of the logic used at each step can be found in determining which OSK preferences are relevant.</p> </li> <li> <p>When an o-supported rule matches, EBBS caches the operator's ROSK in the     instantiation of that rule. Since that selection knowledge was necessary to     select the operator needed for the rule to match, EBBS must backtrace     through that knowledge. Cached ROSK is used to do this and incorporate the     necessary operator selection reasoning knowledge into the learned rule. For     some types of agent designs, including operator selection knowledge is needed     to ensure correctness.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#instantiation-creation","title":"Instantiation Creation","text":"<p>Whenever a rule matches, EBBS creates a record called an instantiation that contains information about what specific working memory elements matched, what elements were created, and extends the instantiation graph by creating links from other instantiations to this instantiation for those instantiations that correspond to rule firings that created the elements tested in the rule.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#identity-assignment-and-propagation","title":"Identity Assignment and Propagation","text":"<p>Each instantiation describes the working memory elements that matched each condition and the working memory elements and preferences that are created by each action.

Identities are not simply IDs. Each identity is a declarative object that describes a set of variables across multiple rule firings and the various properties they hold.</p> <p>When an instantiation is created, EBBS assigns all elements of every condition and action to an identity, creating new identities as necessary.

Since we know that it\u2019s     impossible for there to be two superstate features in a state, all     conditions that test that singleton WME will be assigned the same     identities. While there are a variety of built-in singletons for     architecturally-created WMEs, users can also specify their own     domain-specific singletons to eliminate unnecessary generality when     learning. The full list of architecturally-created singletons can be     found in the <code>chunk</code> command\u2019s help     entry.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>Note that rule 1 may conflict with other rules.

To avoid this, any substate rules which test recalled knowledge must also test superstate structures that correspond to the recalled knowledge. Doing so removes the need for the instructions to exist while avoiding over-generality by ensuring that structures in the superstate corresponding to those instructions are still being tested. Those conditions that test superstate WMEs will be generalized and included in the chunk, but the undesired portion of the reason that they matched will not be, namely the fact that the superstate knowledge corresponded to recalled instructions.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#determining-which-osk-preferences-are-relevant","title":"Determining Which OSK Preferences are Relevant","text":"<p>The following outline describes the logic that happens at each step. For a more detailed description of the various filters (but not the ROSK).  Note that depending on the set of preferences being processed, impasses may occur at some of these stages, in which case, no operator is selected and the ROSK is emptied. Moreover, if the candidate set is reduced to zero or one, the decision process will exit with a finalized ROSK. For simplicity\u2019s sake, this explanation assumes that there are no impasses and the decision process continues.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Require Filter If an operator is selected based on a require preference,     that preference is added to the ROSK. The logic behind this step is     straightforward, the require preference directly resulted in the selection of     the operator.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prohibit/Reject Filters If there exists at least one prohibit or reject     preference, all prohibit and reject preferences for the eliminated candidates     are added to the ROSK. The logic behind this stage is that the conditions that     led to the exclusion of the prohibited and rejected candidates is what allowed     the final operator to be selected from among that particular set of surviving     candidates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Better/Worse Filter For every candidate that is not worse than some     other candidate, add all better/worse preferences involving the candidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Best Filter Add any best preferences for remaining candidates to the ROSK.</p> </li> <li> <p>Worst Filter If any remaining candidate has a worst preference which     leads to that candidate being removed from consideration, that worst preference     is added to the ROSK. Again, the logic is that the conditions that led to that     candidate not being selected allowed the final operator to be chosen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indifferent/Numeric Filter This is the final stage, so the operator is now selected     based on the agent\u2019s exploration policy. How indifferent preferences are added     to the ROSK depends on whether any numeric indifferent preferences exist.</p> <ol> <li>If there exists at least one numeric indifferent preference, then every     numeric preference for the winning candidate is added to the ROSK. There     can be multiple such preferences. Moreover, all binary indifferent     preferences between that winning candidate and candidates without a     numeric preference are added.</li> <li>If all indifferent preferences are non-numeric, then any unary indifferent     preferences for the winning candidate are added to the ROSK. Moreover, all     binary indifferent preferences between that winning candidate and other     candidates are added.</li> </ol> <p>The logic behind adding binary indifferent preferences between the selected operator and the other final candidates is that those binary indifferent preferences prevented a tie impasse and allowed the final candidate to be chosen by the exploration policy from among those mutually indifferent preferences.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that there may be cases where two or more rules create the same type of preference for a particular candidate. In those cases, only the first preference encountered is added to the ROSK. Adding all of them can produce over-specific chunks. It may still be possible to learn similar chunks with those other preferences if the agent subgoals again in a similar context.</p> <p>Note also that operator selection knowledge is not tracked and incorporated into chunks by default. The setting must be turned on via the chunk command\u2019s add-osk setting..</p> <p>The ROSK also affects the conditions of justifications, so the <code>add-desirability-prefs</code> setting does have an effect on the agent even if learning is turned off.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#generalizing-knowledge-from-math","title":"Generalizing Knowledge From Math","text":"<p>EBBS introduces the ability to learn more expressive rules whose actions perform arbitrary right-hand side functions with variablized arguments.</p> <p>It is important to note that this ability is limited. EBBS can only learn rules with generalized RHS functions in its actions when the rule that created the result contained a RHS function. In many cases, RHS functions will be used in the intermediate rule firings in the behavior trace. Not only will these intermediate RHS function not appear in the chunk, but any chunk learned based on their output will become more specific. This is one of the sources of over-specialization referenced in over-specialization and over-generalization on over-specialization.</p> <p>RHS function calls in intermediate rule firings are a challenge for EBBS to deal with because the problem-solving may have placed constraints on the intermediate results that cannot be represented in a single Soar rule.</p> <p>For example, consider the case of one rule that used a RHS function to add two numbers. Now consider another rule that matched the output of the RHS function, but only if it was less than 5. If the second rule matched, it would return the total as a result. How could we encode the reasoning of those two rules into one rule? Since Soar\u2019s production syntax does not allow using RHS function as constraints in conditions, there is no way to insure that the two numbers add up to something less than 5 in a single rule. This is why RHS functions in intermediate rule firings can cause over-specialization.</p> <p>Because the chunk\u2019s conditions can\u2019t represent constraints on the output of intermediate RHS functions, EBBS must literalize both the identities of the variables that appear as arguments to the intermediate RHS function, as well as the identities in any conditions that test the output of the RHS function. That fixes the value of the RHS function and guarantees that any constraints in conditions that test the output of that RHS function will be met. While this will make the learned rule more specific, it will also ensure that the rule is correct.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#situations-in-which-a-chunk-is-not-learned","title":"Situations in which a Chunk is Not Learned","text":"<p>Soar learns a chunk every time a subgoal produces a result, unless one of the following conditions is true:</p> <ol> <li>Chunking is off     This corresponds to the command chunk never.</li> <li>Chunking was only enabled for some states, and the subgoal in question is not     one of them When chunking is enabled via the only or except command, the agent     must specify which states learning either occurs in or doesn\u2019t occur in,     respectively. For the except setting, Soar will learn rules in all states in     which a <code>dont-learn</code> RHS production action was not executed. Similarly, for the     only setting, Soar will learn rules in all states where a <code>force-learn</code> RHS     production action was executed, cf. Controlling chunking     for more information. This capability is provided for debugging and     practical system development, but it is not part of the theory of Soar.</li> <li>The chunk learned is a duplicate of another production or chunk already in     production memory In some rare cases, a duplicate production will not be     detected because the order of the conditions or actions is not the same as an     existing production.</li> <li>The problem-solving in the substate violated one of the enabled correctness     guarantee filters During the development of explanation-based behavior summarization, we have     developed a list of possible causes of incorrect chunks. EBBS\u2019s correctness     guarantee filters detect when those situations occur and prevents a chunk from     being learned. For example, the allow-local-negations filter will prevent a rule     from being formed if the problem-solving that led to the result was     dependent on a condition that tested whether a subgoal WME doesn\u2019t exist.     Since there is no practical way to determine why a piece of knowledge     doesn\u2019t exist, testing a local negation can result in an over-general and     incorrect chunk, cf. prohibiting known sources for correctness issues     for more information. Note that correctness filters have not yet been     implemented for all the identified potential sources of correctness issues.</li> <li>The chunking option bottom-only is on and a chunk was already built in the     bottom subgoal that generated the results With bottom-only chunking, chunks are     learned only in states in which no subgoal has yet generated a chunk. In this     mode, chunks are learned only for the \"bottom\" of the subgoal hierarchy and not     the intermediate levels. With experience, the subgoals at the bottom will be     replaced by the chunks, allowing higher level subgoals to be chunked. See     chunk reference for details of chunk used     with the bottom-only setting.</li> <li>The problem-solving that led to the result contained a condition that tested     the architecturally-created <code>&lt;state&gt; ^quiescence t</code> augmentation This mechanism     is motivated by the chunking from exhaustion problem, where the results of a     subgoal are dependent on the exhaustion of alternatives     (see Problem-Solving that does not test the superstate).     If this substate augmentation is encountered when determining the     conditions of a chunk, then no chunk will be built for the currently considered     action. This is recursive, so that if an un-chunked result is relevant to a     second result, no chunk will be built for the second result. This does not     prevent the creation of a chunk that would include^quiescence tas a condition.</li> <li>The problem-solving in the substate did not test any knowledge in the     superstate In these cases, the chunk learned does not have any conditions     and is not a legal production. Note that this creates an unusual persistence     issue for any results that came out of the substate. Since a justification     or chunk was not learned, there is no rule in the superstate that can     provide either i-support or o-support for the result that came out of the     substate. Consequently, those result WMEs will be completely dependent on     the rules that fired within the substate. So, when the substate is removed,     those results will also be removed.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>More details on the <code>chunk</code> command and its settings can be found in the chunk command reference.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/04_ProceduralKnowledgeLearning/#enabling-procedural-learning","title":"Enabling Procedural Learning","text":"<p>By default, chunking is off.</p> <ul> <li>To turn on chunking: <code>chunk always</code></li> <li>To turn off chunking: <code>chunk never</code></li> </ul> <p>In real world agents, there may be certain problem spaces in which you don't want your agent to learn rules.

In addition to all of the dependencies between the rules that fired, this visualization also shows which conditions in the instantiations tested knowledge in the superstate and hence became the basis for a condition in the final learned rule. Finally, the individual elements in the explanation are color-coded to show which variables share the same identity.</p> </li> <li> <p>An image that shows the graph of how variable identities were     combined.</p> <p>Use the <code>visualize identity graph</code> to create a graph that shows how identities were used to determine the variablization of a learned rule.

RL rules are identified by syntax. A production is a RL rule if and only if its left hand side tests for a proposed operator, its right hand side creates a single numeric-indifferent preference, and it is not a template rule (see rule templates). These constraints ease the technical requirements of identifying/ updating RL rules and makes it easy for the agent programmer to add/ maintain RL capabilities within an agent. We define an RL operator as an operator with numeric-indifferent preferences created by RL rules.</p> <p>The following is an RL rule:</p> <pre><code>sp {rl*3*12*left\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name task-name\n      ^x 3\n      ^y 12\n      ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n   (&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n      ^direction left)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; = 1.5)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the LHS of the rule can test for anything as long as it contains a test for a proposed operator.

The most straightforward way to achieve this is to give the agent a set of RL rules, each matching exactly one possible state-operator pair. This approach is equivalent to a table-based RL algorithm, where the \\(Q\\)-value of each state-operator pair corresponds to the numeric-indifferent preference created by exactly one RL rule.</p> <p>In the more general case, multiple RL rules can match a single state-operator pair, and a single RL rule can match multiple state-operator pairs. That is, in Soar, a state-operator pair corresponds to an operator in a specific working memory context, and multiple rules can modify the preferences for a single operator, and a single rule can be instantiated multiple ways to modify preferences for multiple operators. For RL in Soar, all numeric-indifferent preferences for an operator are summed when calculating the operator\u2019s \\(Q\\)-value.</p> Info <p>This is assuming the value of numeric-indifferent-mode is set to sum. In general, the RL mechanism only works correctly when this is the case, and we assume this case in the rest of the chapter.</p> <p>In this context, RL rules can be interpreted more generally as binary features in a linear approximator of each state-operator pair\u2019s \\(Q\\)-value, and their numeric-indifferent preference values their weights. In other words,</p> \\[Q(s, a) = w_1 \\phi_1 (s, a) + w_2 \\phi_2 (s, a) + \\ldots + w_n \\phi_n (s, a)\\] <p>where all RL rules in production memory are numbered \\(1 \\dots n\\), \\(Q(s, a)\\) is the \\(Q\\)-value of the state-operator pair \\((s, a)\\), \\(w_i\\) is the numeric-indifferent preference value of RL rule \\(i\\), \\(\\phi_i (s, a) = 0\\) if RL rule \\(i\\) does not match \\((s, a)\\), and \\(\\phi_i (s, a) = 1\\) if it does.

In Soar, these reward signals are given to the RL mechanism through a working memory link called the reward-link. Each state in Soar\u2019s state stack is automatically populated with a <code>reward-link</code> structure upon creation. Soar will check each structure for a numeric reward signal for the last operator executed in the associated state at the beginning of every decision phase. Reward is also collected when the agent is halted or a state is retracted.</p> <p>In order to be recognized, the reward signal must follow this pattern:</p> <pre><code>(&lt;r1&gt; ^reward &lt;r2&gt;)\n(&lt;r2&gt; ^value [val])\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>&lt;r1&gt;</code> is the <code>reward-link</code> identifier, <code>&lt;r2&gt;</code> is some intermediate identifier, and <code>[val]</code> is any constant numeric value. Any structure that does not match this pattern is ignored. If there are multiple valid reward signals, their values are summed into a single reward signal. As an example, consider the following state:</p> <pre><code>(S1 ^reward-link R1)\n   (R1 ^reward R2)\n      (R2 ^value 1.0)\n   (R1 ^reward R3)\n      (R3 ^value -0.2)\n</code></pre> <p>In this state, there are two reward signals with values 1.0 and -0.2. They will be summed together for a total reward of 0.8 and this will be the value given to the RL update algorithm.</p> <p>There are two reasons for requiring the intermediate identifier. The first is so that multiple reward signals with the same value can exist simultaneously. Since working memory is a set, multiple WMEs with identical values in all three positions (identifier, attribute, value) cannot exist simultaneously. Without an intermediate identifier, specifying two rewards with the same value would require a WME structure such as</p> <pre><code>(S1 ^reward-link R1)\n   (R1 ^reward 1.0)\n   (R1 ^reward 1.0)\n</code></pre> <p>which is invalid. With the intermediate identifier, the rewards would be specified as</p> <pre><code>(S1 ^reward-link R1)\n   (R1 ^reward R2)\n      (R2 ^value 1.0)\n   (R1 ^reward R3)\n      (R3 ^value 1.0)\n</code></pre> <p>which is valid. The second reason for requiring an intermediate identifier in the reward signal is so that the rewards can be augmented with additional information, such as their source or how long they have existed. Although this information will be ignored by the RL mechanism, it can be useful to the agent or programmer. For example:</p> <pre><code>(S1 ^reward-link R1)\n   (R1 ^reward R2)\n      (R2 ^value 1.0)\n      (R2 ^source environment)\n   (R1 ^reward R3)\n      (R3 ^value -0.2)\n      (R3 ^source intrinsic)\n      (R3 ^duration 5)\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>(R2 ^source environment)</code>, <code>(R3 ^source intrinsic)</code>, and <code>(R3 ^duration 5)</code> WMEs are arbitrary and ignored by RL, but were added by the agent to keep track of where the rewards came from and for how long.</p> <p>Note that the <code>reward-link</code> is not part of the io structure and is not modified directly by the environment. Reward information from the environment should be copied, via rules, from the <code>input-link</code> to the reward-link. Also note that when collecting rewards, Soar simply scans the <code>reward-link</code> and sums the values of all valid reward WMEs. The WMEs are not modified and no bookkeeping is done to keep track of previously seen WMEs. This means that reward WMEs that exist for multiple decision cycles will be collected multiple times if not removed or retracted.</p>"},{"location":"soar_manual/05_ReinforcementLearning/#updating-rl-rule-values","title":"Updating RL Rule Values","text":"<p>Soar\u2019s RL mechanism is integrated naturally with the decision cycle and performs online updates of RL rules.

(In Soar, \\(k\\) is hard-coded to \\(10\\).) To use base-level activation, use the following CLI command when sourcing an agent:</p> <pre><code>smem --set activation-mode base-level\n</code></pre> <p>Spreading activation is new to Soar 9.6.0 and provides a secondary type of activation beyond the previous methods. First, spreading activation requires that base-level activation is also being used. They are considered additive. This value does not represent recency or frequency of use, but rather context-relatedness. Spreading activation increases the activation of LTIs which are linked to by identifiers currently present in working memory. Such LTIs may be thought of as spreading sources.</p> Info <p>Specifically, linked to by STIs that have augmentations.</p> <p>Spreading activation values spread according to network structure. That is, spreading sources will add to the spreading activation values of any of their child LTIs, according to the directed graph structure within smem (not working memory). The amount of spread is controlled by the <code>spreading-continue-probability</code> parameter. By default this value is set to 0.9. This would mean that \\(90\\ \\%\\) of an LTI\u2019s spreading activation value would be divided among its direct children (without subtracting from its own value). This value is multiplicative with depth. A \"grandchild\" LTI, connected at a distance of two from a source LTI, would receive spreading according to \\(0.9 \\times 0.9 = 0.81\\) of the source spreading activation value.</p> <p>Spreading activation values are updated each decision cycle only as needed for specific smem retrievals. For efficiency, two limits exist for the amount of spread calculated. The <code>spreading-limit</code> parameter limits how many LTIs can receive spread from a given spreading source LTI. By default, this value is (300). Spread is distributed in a magnitude-first manner to all descendants of a source. (Without edge-weights, this simplifies to breadth-first.) Once the number of LTIs that have been given spread from a given source reaches the max value indicated by <code>spreading-limit</code>, no more is calculated for that source that update cycle, and the next spreading source\u2019s contributions are calculated. The maximum depth of descendants that can receive spread contributions from a source is similarly given by the <code>spreading-depth-limit</code> parameter. By default, this value is (10).</p> <p>In order to use spreading activation, use the following command:</p> <pre><code>smem --set spreading on\n</code></pre> <p>Also, spreading activation can make use of working memory activation for adjusting edge weights and for providing nonuniform initial magnitude of spreading for sources of spread. This functionality is optional. To enable the updating of edge-weights, use the command:</p> <pre><code>smem --set spreading-edge-updating on\n</code></pre> <p>and to enable working memory activation to modulate the magnitude of spread from sources, use the command:</p> <pre><code>smem --set spreading-wma-source on\n</code></pre> <p>For most use-cases, base-level activation is sufficient to provide an agent with relevant knowledge in response to a query.

The <code>off</code> setting will write each change to disk and thus incurs massive I/O delay.</p> <p>The next parameter is thresh. This has to do with the locality of storing/updating activation information with semantic augmentations. By default, all WME augmentations are incrementally sorted by activation, such that cue-based retrievals need not sort large number of candidate long-term identifiers on demand, and thus retrieval time is independent of cue selectivity. However, each activation update (such as after a retrieval) incurs an update cost linear in the number of augmentations. If the number of augmentations for a long-term identifier is large, this cost can dominate. Thus, the <code>thresh</code> parameter sets the upper bound of augmentations, after which activation is stored with the long-term identifier. This allows the user to establish a balance between cost of updating augmentation activation and the number of long-term identifiers that must be pre-sorted during a cue-based retrieval. As long as the threshold is greater than the number of augmentations of most long-term identifiers, performance should be fine (as it will bound the effects of selectivity).</p> <p>The next two parameters deal with the SQLite cache, which is a memory store used to speed operations like queries by keeping in memory structures like levels of index B+-trees. The first parameter, page-size, indicates the size, in bytes, of each cache page. The second parameter, cache-size, suggests to SQLite how many pages are available for the cache. Total cache size is the product of these two parameter settings. The cache memory is not pre- allocated, so short/small runs will not necessarily make use of this space.

Nuxoll has produced initial evidence that in some tasks, retrieval quality improves when using activation of cue WMEs as a form of feature weighting. Thus, episodic memory supports integration with working memory activation (see the Soar Manual working memory activation section). For a theoretical discussion of the Soar implementation of working memory activation, consider readingComprehensive Working Memory Activation in Soar (Nuxoll, A., Laird, J., James, M., ICCM 2004).</p> <p>The cue-based retrieval process can be thought of conceptually as a nearest-neighbor search.  First, all candidate episodes, defined as episodes containing at least one leaf WME (a cue WME with no sub-structure) in at least one cue, are identified. Two quantities are calculated for each candidate episode, with respect to the supplied cue(s): the cardinality of the match (defined as the number of matching leaf WMEs) and the activation of the match (defined as the sum of the activation values of each matching leaf WME). Note that each of these values is negated when applied to a negative query. To compute each candidate episode\u2019s match score, these quantities are combined with respect to the balance parameter as follows:</p> \\[ (balance)\\cdot(cardinality) + (1-balance)\\cdot(activation) \\] <p>Performing a graph match on each candidate episode, with respect to the structure of the cue, could be very computationally expensive, so episodic memory implements a two-stage matching process. An episode with perfect cardinality is considered a perfect surface match and, per the graph-match parameter, is subjected to further structural matching. Whereas surface matching efficiently determines if all paths to leaf WMEs exist in a candidate episode, graph matching indicates whether or not the cue can be structurally unified with the candidate episode (paying special regard to the structural constraints imposed by shared identifiers). Cue-based matching will return the most recent structural match, or the most recent candidate episode with the greatest match score.</p> <p>A special note should be made with respect to how short- vs. long-term identifiers (see Knowledge Representation) are interpreted in a cue. Short-term identifiers are processed much as they are in working memory \u2013 transient structures. Cue matching will try to find any identifier in an episode (with respect to WME path from state) that can apply. Long-term identifiers, however, are treated as constants.

Group nodes represent objects that are the aggregates of their child nodes, such as the car object in the example. The shape of a group node is the union of the shapes of its children. Structuring complex objects in this way allows Soar to reason about them naturally at different levels of abstraction. The agent can query SVS for relationships between the car as a whole with other objects (e.g. does it intersect the pole?), or the relationships between its parts (e.g. are the wheels pointing left or right with respect to the chassis?).

Filters can be arranged into pipelines in which the outputs of some filters are fed into the inputs of other filters.

Here, the outputs of the <code>car</code> and <code>pole</code> node filters are fed into the <code>^a</code> and <code>^b</code> parameters of the filter.

Therefore, the command has the form <code>svs PATH [ARGUMENTS]</code>, where <code>PATH</code> uniquely identifies an object or the method of an object. <code>ARGUMENTS</code> is a space separated list of strings that each object or function interprets in its own way. For example, <code>svs S1.scene.world.car</code> identifies the car object in the scene graph of the top state.

On Linux and OS X, the default settings are probably sufficient,   but you can experiment with new settings if you want (let us know if you find   better settings).</li> <li>Put primary application and Soar in the same process. That is, use   <code>CreateInNewThread</code> or <code>CreateInCurrentThread</code>, not <code>CreateRemoteConnection</code>. Using a   remote kernel means socket communications are used, which is slow.</li> <li>Don't register for unnecessary events. Every event that is registered for   causes extra work to be done. Try to find an appropriate event to register for   so you don't end up getting more event calls than you actually need - that is,   try to avoid registering for events which occur more frequently than you need   and then filtering them on the application side.</li> <li>Don't connect the debugger. Connecting the debugger creates a remote   connection and also registers for several events.</li> <li>Set watch level 0. Even if you don't have a client registered for any of the   print or XML events, work is still done internally to generate some of the   information that would have been sent out. Setting watch level 0 avoids this   work.</li> <li>Disable monitor productions. Again, even if no client is registered to print   out the text of monitor productions, work is still done internally to prepare   the text. Monitor productions can be disabled by excising them or commenting   them out, but an easier method is to have each monitor production test a debug   flag in working memory which is set by some initialization production or   operator. Thus all of the monitor productions can be turned on or off by   changing one line of code.</li> <li>Disable timers. Soar uses timers internally to generate the output of the   stats command. If you don't need this information, you can use the timers - off   command to disable this bookkeeping. This can make a significant difference in   the watch 0 case.</li> <li>Avoid running agents separately. Instead of calling <code>RunSelf</code> or   <code>RunSelfTilOutput</code> on each agent, just call <code>RunAllAgents</code> on the kernel itself.   This runs all agents together and avoids the overhead of running them   separately. The absolute best you can do is to call <code>RunAllAgentsForever</code> as   described in section 2.4 - this avoids repeatedly calling the run functions at   all and will make it easier to stop and restart your application from the   debugger (or other clients).</li> <li>In the case where the absolute best performance under SML is desired, use   <code>CreateKernelInCurrentThread</code> instead of <code>CreateKernelInNewThread</code> and set the   \"optimized\" flag to true in the parameters passed to   <code>CreateKernelInCurrentThread</code>. This means Soar will execute in the same thread as   your application. Without this each call to and from the Soar kernel requires a   context switch (assuming a single processor machine). This method also   eliminates the thread which polls for new events. This means you must poll for   the events yourself by periodically calling <code>CheckForIncomingCommands</code>, which is   a little more work for the programmer.</li> </ul>","tags":["sml"]},{"location":"tutorials/IntroSoarDebugger/","title":"Introduction to the Soar Debugger","text":"<p>The Soar Java Debugger is distributed with Soar, and can be launched by double-clicking either <code>SoarJavaDebugger.bat</code> or <code>SoarJavaDebugger.sh</code> in the root directory of Soar.</p>","tags":["debugger","agent debugging"]},{"location":"tutorials/IntroSoarDebugger/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>With Soar 8.6 we made a new method for interfacing into Soar based around SML (Soar Markup Language).

We compared the performance of these two different forms of window to the performance of the TSI debugger included with 8.5.2 on the towers of Hanoi task.</p> <p>Method is to maximize each window then use <code>time {run x}</code> in TSI or <code>time run x</code> in Java Debugger to time each run. Obviously, times could vary from run to run, but in practice the variance is usually small.

Below is a simple rule written in English.</p> <pre><code>hello-world:\nIf I exist, then write \u201cHello World\u201d and halt.\n</code></pre> <p>Soar cannot directly interpret English, so you must write rules in Soar\u2019s very stylized and precise language. A major component of the rest of this tutorial is teaching you that language.</p> <p>Soar works by testing the \u201dif\u201d parts of rules (\u201cIf I exist\u201d). These \u201dif\u201d parts are called conditions. If all of the conditions of a rule are true in the current situation, the \u201dthen\u201d parts, or actions, of the rule (\u201cwrite \u2018Hello World\u2019 and halt\u201d) are executed, which usually involves making changes to working memory, which holds all of the dynamic data structures in a Soar program. Executing the actions of a rule is called firing the rule. To determine if the conditions are true, Soar compares them to data structures in working memory. Working memory defines the current situation, which for an agent consists of its perception of its world, results of intermediate calculations, active goals, and operators.</p> <p>The figure below shows a high level view of Soar. On the right are all of the underlying architectural processes that select operators, create states, learn new rules, etc. These are all written in C and you will not be changing them at all (so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know C). In the upper center is the rule memory, which contains all of the rules. Rules encode the long-term knowledge in Soar and adding them is the way Soar is programmed \u2013 you do not change the way Soar creates states or learns, but you create rules. Working memory is where short-term information is stored and your rules will create and test structures in working memory. In contrast to C or Java, which have programs that are executed sequentially, Soar has rules that are matched and executed in parallel. C and Java have data structures, variables, etc. while Soar has working memory. While these other languages have a combination of local and global data, Soar has no local data \u2013 everything in working memory is global. Working memory consists of a graph structure of individual elements. The elements are created by rules as well as from sensors (not shown in the diagram), and the Soar architecture creates a limited set of working memory elements (the core part of states) automatically. Working memory is matched against rule memory to determine which rules will fire. When rules fire, they can make changes to working memory, as well as performing simple actions such as printing messages in the interaction window.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#loading-and-running-hello-world","title":"Loading and Running Hello-World","text":"<p>Before going through the nitty-gritty of Soar syntax, let\u2019s see an example of Soar executing the hello-world rule.

The first thing that happens is that Soar automatically creates the initial state, S1 (but this is not shown in the interaction window, but is shown in the window on the right where the state S1 is printed). All of working memory is organized as states, so even before any rules fire, a state is created. After the state is created the rule matches (details explained later) and it fires, performing its actions, printing \u201cHello World\u201d and then halting.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#hello-world-rule-soar","title":"Hello-World Rule: Soar","text":"<p>As stated earlier, Soar has a stylized and precise language for writing rules.

The one exception is that a name cannot be a single letter followed by a number such as S1 or O45. Soar reserves those names for its own purposes. The specific name is irrelevant to the operation of the rule, but you should always pick a name that is meaningful. Following the name, there must be at least one condition. A condition tests for the existence (or absence) of data in working memory. If all of the conditions match, then the rule will fire and all of the actions are performed. Most actions create new working memory elements or remove existing working memory elements. Some actions create preferences for selecting operators (more on that later), while others perform functions such as writing text to the screen or halting as in hello-world.</p> <p>In the next several sections we will explore the structure of conditions and actions and explain what all of the special symbols, such as <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> and ^type, mean. Before doing that, we need to first look at the structure of working memory in more detail.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#working-memory","title":"Working Memory","text":"<p>Working memory contains all of a Soar agent\u2019s dynamic information about its world and its internal reasoning. It contains sensor data, intermediate calculations, current operators and goals. In Soar, all of working memory is organized as graph structures in states. Thus, every working memory element is connected directly or indirectly to a state symbol. For the first agents you will build, there will be a single state. Below is a simple example of what the structure of working memory might be like if the agent were representing that there were two blocks, one on top of the other, which is then on a table as shown in the figure below.</p> <p>Below is a graphic picture of the working memory structures that Soar creates automatically for every agent \u2013 so although not shown in the above figure, S1 would have these additional structures.</p> <p>As a graph, there are nodes (or vertices) and links (or edges). The nodes, such as S1, B1, B2, A, and blue, are connected by links, such as block, table, name, color, and superstate. Soar has two kinds of nodes: identifiers and constants. The nodes that can have links emanating from them (they are non-terminal nodes), such as S1 and B1, are called identifiers, while the others (they are terminal nodes), such as state, blue, block, and nil, are called constants.</p> <p>In the example above, S1 is the identifier for the state. All of the identifiers symbols are created automatically by Soar and consist of a single letter followed by a number. Although I2 and I3 in the lower figure do not have any links emanating from them, they are identifiers and can have additional substructures added later. In contrast, the symbol state is not an identifier and cannot have links emanating from it. The links are called attributes in Soar and are prefaced by a \u201c^\u201d. Only identifiers have attributes. In the bottom figure, S1 has three attributes: superstate, io, and type. I1 has two: output-link and input-link.</p> <p>Working memory is actually built of individual elements which are triples of an identifier, an attribute, and value, and where the value is that node pointed to by the attribute. The value can be either a constant or an identifier. In the example above, the symbols nil, I1, state, I2, and I3 are all values. It is these triples that you add and delete when writing Soar programs.</p> <p>There are five working memory elements in the figure above:</p> <pre><code>S1 ^superstate nil\nS1 ^io I1\nS1 ^type state\nI1 ^output-link I2\nI1 ^input-link I3\n</code></pre> <p>This is the minimal contents of working memory, and as your programs get larger and more complex, they will manipulate many more working memory elements.</p> <p>A collection of working memory elements that share the same first identifier is called an object. For example, the three working memory elements that have S1 as their identifier are all part of the state object. The working memory elements that make up an object are called augmentations. Although we call them objects, they consist of the individual working memory elements that share the same identifier. Objects are usually written as a list of the augmentations surrounded by parentheses. The first item in the list is the identifier that is shared by all of the augmentations, followed by the pairs of attributes and values for each augmentation. The objects for the above working memory elements are:</p> <pre><code>(S1 ^io I1 ^superstate nil ^type state)\n(I1 ^input-link I3 ^output-link I2)\n</code></pre> <p>An individual augmentation can also be written in this form: <code>(S1 ^type state)</code></p> <p>A working memory object usually represents something about the world, such as a block, a wall, a piece of food, or a cell on the board. The individual augmentations represent properties (such as color, size, or weight), or relations with other objects (such as on top of, behind, or inside).</p> <p>Soar can be used for many different tasks, and for each different task, working memory will contain descriptions of the task objects. The working memory elements for the blocks would be as follows:</p> <p>Working memory usually also contains objects that are only conceptual things and do not have an identifiable physical existence, such as state s1, which organizes other objects, relations, and properties. The exact representation of objects is up to you, the designer of a Soar program.</p> <p>Soar does not require any declarations of the possible attributes and constants. In fact, some Soar programs generate new attributes and constant values as they execute. The Soar editing and development tool, VisualSoar, does require declarations for the structure of working memory elements, and those declarations are used to check for errors in your rules but they are not used by Soar when it is executing a program.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#hello-world-rule-soar-details","title":"Hello-World Rule: Soar Details","text":"<p>You now know enough to return to the first example rule. The original English version included the test</p> <p>\u201cIf I exist\u201d</p> <p>Remember that when every Soar agent is created, it has <code>(s1 ^type state)</code> in working memory, which signifies in someway that the agent does exist. Thus, you can test for the presence of that structure in working memory to determine if the agent exists. The obvious condition to write would be <code>(s1 ^type state)</code>. However, s1 is just an arbitrary symbol and might not be the identifier of that state every time the agent is run.[1] Thus, we need a test that there is an identifier, but without testing a specific value. That is exactly what a variable does \u2013 it matches any symbol in working memory with the only constraint being that all occurrences of the same variable in a rule match the same symbol. A variable can match an identifier, an attribute, or a value, depending on its position in a condition - if it is first in a condition it will match the identifier, second the attribute, and third the value. A variable is a symbol surrounded by <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, such as <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>. The exact symbol used in the variable (such as \u201cs\u201d) is irrelevant but should be picked to be meaningful to you.</p> <p>Putting these pieces together gives: <code>(&lt;s&gt; ^type state)</code>. That is almost correct, but in Soar, every rule must start by matching a structure in a state, and to remind you of this, the first condition of every rule must start with the word \u201cstate\u201d.</p> <pre><code>sp {hello-world\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^type state)\n--&gt;\n(write |Hello World|)\n(halt)}\n</code></pre> <p>The original text for the rule\u2019s actions was: then write \u201cHello World\u201d and halt.</p> <p>The rule\u2019s first action prints \u201cHello World\u201d in the Interaction window. Vertical bars, \u201c|\u201d, mark constants with special characters. These constants can contain any characters, which allows you to print spaces, upper and lower-case letters. The second action is a special command in Soar that halts the agent. From this simple example, you should be able to write your own rules that print out different messages for Soar.</p> <p>If you wish to try this out yourself, you have two choices. The first is to use VisualSoar. VisualSoar is the Soar development environment and it lets you develop and manage Soar programs. It has its own documentation and tutorial and can be found at the Soar web pages. Also, the Water-Jug problem that is presented later in this tutorial contains an explanation of how to use VisualSoar. Although it will initially slow you down to learn VisualSoar, it will be worth it in the long run.</p> <p>If you want to use a text editor, almost any will do, such as Word, WordPerfect, Wordpad, Notepad, or Emacs. In this editor, create a new file hello-world.soar in your new folder/directory. Make sure the file ends in \u201c.soar\u201d. This may be difficult to do in Wordpad or Notepad, which automatically add \u201c.txt\u201d to the end of a file, but this will be important for the Eaters and Tanksoar tasks. If you are having trouble with this in Windows, go to the Settings item off the Start menu. Select Folder Options and the pick the File Type tab. Select \"New Type\u2026\" and in the pop-up window define the soar type. You need to fill in \"soar\" (without quotes) under the \"Associated extension\" and select \"text/plain\" under \"Content Type.\" Whenever you save the file, make sure you save it as a text file with linefeeds. Soar cannot handle formatted text and text without linefeeds.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#building-simple-agents-using-operators","title":"Building Simple Agents Using Operators","text":"<p>In this section, you will learn how to use rules to select and apply operators. Operators perform actions, either in the world or internally in the \u201cmind\u201d of an agent. In the Water Jug problem, they \u201cpour\u201d water between jugs in the mind of the agent. In Eaters, the operators will create commands to move the eater around the board. There could also be operators to remember uneaten food, count food, or remember where walls are that only make changes to the working memory of the Eater. Operators in a Tic Tac Toe program would mark X\u2019s or O\u2019s on the board. Operators for a soccer program would probably include move, turn, kick the ball, send messages to teammates, interpret messages from teammates, choose a tactic or strategy, and so on.</p> <p>Because operators perform actions, they are the locus of decision making. They are where knowledge is used to decide what to do (or not to do). Thus, Soar\u2019s basic operation is a cycle in which operators are continually proposed, selected, and applied. Rules fire to propose and apply operators, while the decision procedure selects the current operator. This may seem restrictive; however, it forces you to separate out where decisions are being made (proposal and selection) and where actions are being performed (application).</p> <p>For Soar to use operators, they must first be created in working memory by proposal rules. Proposal rules test features of the state to ensure that the operator is appropriate and then they create a representation of the operator in working memory along with an acceptable preference for that operator. The preference is a way of telling the architecture that this operator is a candidate for selection. For simple operators, the representation in working memory is often just a name of the operator. For example, in section 3.1 we will create an operator to print \u201cHello World\u201d and that operator will just have the name hello-world in working memory. More complex operators can also contain representations of parameters. For example, when we encode the water jug problem in Soar, one operator will fill a jug with water and it will have a parameter as to which jug should be filled. At an extreme, the representation of an operator can specify exactly which changes should be made to working memory when it is applied.</p> <p>Once the operator is selected, rules that apply the operator will match and perform whatever actions are appropriate by creating or removing working memory elements. If the chosen operator is represented in working memory as just a name, rules that explicitly test that name will be required to apply that operator. If the operator already includes a representation of what changes need to be made, then very general rules can be used to apply the operator that can also be used with other operators. Thus, working memory acts as an intermediary for actions by being the place where alternative operators are proposed, one is selected, and then rules apply the operator by making changes to the state.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#hello-world-operator-english-version","title":"Hello World Operator: English Version","text":"<p>To demonstrate a very simple operator, you will now write an operator instead of a single rule to print \u201cHello World\u201d. Operators allow you to have an action considered in multiple situations (rules that propose the operator), allow multiple reasons for selecting an action (rules for selecting operators), and allow multiple ways for doing it (rules that apply the operator). For printing \u201cHello World\u201d, an operator is not necessary because there are no alternatives, but as soon as other actions are possible and choices must be made, operators become necessary.</p> <p>To use an operator, we need two rules: one to propose the operator and one to apply it:</p> <pre><code>Propose*hello-world:\nIf I exist, propose the hello-world operator.\n\nApply*hello-world:\nIf the hello-world operator is selected, write \u201cHello World\u201d and halt.\n</code></pre> <p>The first rule proposes the hello-world operator, and the second performs its actions after the operator has been selected. Notice that the first rule only proposes the hello-world operator. As described earlier, an operator is selected by Soar\u2019s decision procedure, which collects together proposed operators and selects one.</p> <p>To see this operator run, you can either create a new agent and then destroy your previous agent (this is done on the same pull down menu that was used to create an agent), or you can remove all of the existing rules in your agent by using the \u201cexcise --all\u201d command, which removes all of the rules from memory and initializes Soar. Next, load in the hello-world-operator file using source. To see the individual productions fire, you can modify the \u201cwatch\u201d level. There are many different watch levels: and watch level 3 (and higher) includes traces of production firings. Go ahead and set the highest level: watch 5. You can use the \u201cWatch 5\u201d button at the bottom of the interaction window or use the Debug Level entry in the menu bar at the top. Then click the run button.</p> <p>The interaction window allows you to trace the execution of Soar at many different levels (decisions, phases, production firings, working memory changes), but selectively view the trace by expanding and collapsing the trace (using the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d items on the left of the trace) and setting filters. Make sure you have the \u201ctree view,\u201d which is set under the layout tab in the top tool bar. A standard practice is to do a full trace (Watch 5), but only view decisions by collapsing the trace. If an error arises, or you want to look at the behavior in more detail, you can expand the trace. The button at the lower right corner of the interaction window allows you to toggle between \u201ccollapse\u201d and \u201cexpand\u201d easily. You can then control the level of the trace by using the \u201cfilters\u201d button that is next to the collapse/expand button. This allows you to view the trace at a high level and only dive into the details when necessary.</p> <p>After typing run, expand the \u201crun\u201d and \u201c1: O: O1 (hello-world)\u201d lines by clicking on the \u201c+\u201d signs next to them. The trace shows that proposehello-world fires first to propose the operator. The operator hello-world (O1) is then selected (by the decision procedure). After hello-world is selected, applyhello-world fires and performs the actions of the operator by printing out \u201cHello World\u201d and halting.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#hello-world-operator-soar-version","title":"Hello-World Operator: Soar Version","text":"<p>In this case, there is a one-to-one mapping of the English rules to Soar rules. The condition of <code>propose*hello-world</code> is the same as the condition for the original hello-world rule. The difference is in the action, where <code>propose*hello-world</code> proposes the hello-world operator. A rule proposes an operator by creating an acceptable preference for the operator. An acceptable preference is a statement that an operator is as a candidate for selection. The rule below proposes the hello-world operator:</p> <pre><code>sp {propose*hello-world\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^type state)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name hello-world)}\n</code></pre> <p>The first action creates an acceptable preference for a new operator (which is added to working memory) and the second action creates a working memory element that augments the operator with its name.</p> <p>A preference looks just like other working memory elements except that it has a fourth item: the type of preference, which in this case is \u201c+\u201d. The identifier of the preference is <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>, which means that the identifier matched to <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> in the condition is used in creating the action. For example, if working memory contained <code>(s1 ^type state)</code>, then when this rule fired the preference would begin with (<code>s1 ^operator</code>. The value of the preference, <code>&lt;o&gt;</code>, is a new variable that did not occur in the condition. When new variables appear in actions, Soar automatically creates a new identifier and uses it for all occurrences of that variable in the action. For example, if o1 is the identifier created for <code>&lt;o&gt;</code>, then <code>(s1 ^operator o1 +)</code> and <code>(o1 ^name hello-world)</code> are added to working memory. For variables in actions, such as <code>&lt;o&gt;</code>, a different identifier is created each time a rule fires.</p> <p>Additional rules may create preferences to compare operators. The decision procedure selects an operator based on all the created preferences. If a single operator is proposed, that operator is selected. In this case, <code>propose*hello-world</code> fires creating a single acceptable preference for o1, and then the decision procedure selects o1 to be the current operator and adds <code>(s1 ^operator o1)</code> to working memory. Note that this working memory augmentation does not have the \u201c+\u201d following the value. Only the decision procedure can add such an operator augmentation for a state to working memory (while proposal rules can add acceptable preferences for operators that differ by ending with the \u201c+\u201d).</p> <p>Once the operator is selected, <code>apply*hello-world</code> should fire.</p> <pre><code>sp {apply*hello-world\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)\n  (&lt;o&gt; ^name hello-world)\n--&gt;\n  (write |Hello World|)\n  (halt)}\n</code></pre> <p>This rule has exactly the same actions as <code>hello*world</code>, but with conditions that test that the operator hello-world has been selected. The first condition tests that some operator has been selected. We cannot include a specific identifier for the value (such as o1) because the exact value of the identifier can be different each time we run the program, so a variable, in this case , is used. <p>The second condition tests that some object in working memory has name hello-world. The rule will only match if both <code>&lt;o&gt;</code>\u2019s match the same identifier (such as o1). This is true for all variables in Soar; if the same variable shows up multiple times in the conditions of a rule, the rule will not match (and fire) unless all occurrences of the variable in the rule match the same symbol in working memory. In this case, they both match o1, and this rule fires.</p> <p>If the same variable is used in multiple rules, it can match completely different identifiers or constants \u2013 that is, the identity of variables only matters within a rule. The exact symbols used in a variable are irrelevant, although as a general convention, <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is usually used to match state identifiers and <code>&lt;o&gt;</code> is usually used to match operator identifiers.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#examining-working-memory","title":"Examining Working Memory","text":"<p>We can get an even more detailed look at Soar\u2019s processing by examining the data structures in working memory.

To print out all of the attributes and values that have s1 as the identifier, first click in command box below the interaction window, and type <code>print s1</code> followed by the \u201cEnter\u201d key. The debugger also has additional windows to the right of the Interaction Window that display common structures, such as the current state, the current operator, etc. The topmost window on the right should already show the state. This window has tabs for examining different structures in working memory. You can modify the command in these windows by typing in a new command (such as replacing \u201cprint s1\u201d with \u201cprint s1 \u2013d 2\u201d), or you can add new tabs or create a new window that executes different commands. You do this by right clicking on a blank part of the window, and a menu will appear that let\u2019s you create a new window or a new tab.</p> <p>You now see all of the attributes and values that have S1 as their identifier. The attributes io, superstate, and type are created automatically for the state before the program starts to run. The operator attribute is created when the hello-world operator (o1) is selected. Only the selected operator has a working memory element without the following \u201c+\u201d. In addition to the selected operator, the acceptable preference for the operator is there, marked with the \"+\". If there were additional operators proposed with acceptable preferences, there would be additional working memory elements with the operator attribute with the ids of the operators followed by the \u201c+\u201d, but for a given state there is only one working memory element with the operator attribute without the \u201c+\u201d, which signifies the selected operator. The attributes are ordered alphabetically when they are printed, but that is just to make it easier to find a specific attribute.</p> <p>We can examine more of the structure of o1 using the print command. This time, select the operator tab or type <code>p o1</code>. The letter p means \u201cprint.\u201d Almost all commands in Soar also have one or two-character shortcuts.</p> <p>Operator o1 has an augmentation with attribute name and value hello-world. We can also examine the augmentations of some of the other values. I1 is the value of the ^io attribute, which stands for input-output. To see more about input and output, print I1. However, instead of using the print or p command, you can use the mouse to print information about I1. (If you don\u2019t have a mouse, just use print.) To do this, type print s1 again as before and move the cursor over I1 in the upper right window, then press the right mouse button. A menu will appear that has a list of commands: print, preferences, WMEs, productions, and run. Move the mouse over the print command and click the left button once.</p> <p>The information for I1 now appears in the Interaction window to the left where the trace is displayed.</p> <p>There are two attributes of io: input-link and output-link.

At the root is the name of your project, and the four things below it are the default files that are automatically created. The specifics of these four files will be explained as the tutorial proceeds. It is files like these that will contain the rules you write for an agent. The rules will be grouped into different files and file types depending on their function. It is from this window that you will control the way the rules are grouped together.

Doing this displays the hierarchical structure of the working memory of your agent in the Datamap water-jug window.

One holds five gallons of water and the other holds three gallons. There is a well that has unlimited water that you can use to completely fill the jugs. You can also empty a jug or pour water from one jug to another. There are no marks for intermediate levels on the jugs. The goal is to fill the three-gallon jug with one gallon of water.</p> <p>The first step in formulating a problem is determining the space of possible states that the problem solver can be in. The space of states, or problem space, is determined by the objects that are available to be manipulated (the two jugs) and their possible values (0-5 gallons full). A problem is then defined as an initial state that the problem solver starts at, (in this case two empty jugs) and a set of desired states (any state where the three-gallon jug has one gallon of water). Problem solving consists of starting at the initial state, then searching for a desired state by applying operators, which transform one state into another. For the water jug problem, the operators are fill a jug, empty a jug, and pour from one jug to the other.</p> <p>In addition to the knowledge required to formulate the problem, knowledge can be used to select which operator to apply at each state. In the water jug, you might have knowledge that specifies never emptying a jug immediately after it has been filled. In Soar, this knowledge is often called search control knowledge, because operator selection is the locus of all decision making in Soar. It is the one place where multiple alternatives can be proposed, compared and evaluated before a selection is made. An important part of Soar\u2019s design is that it makes it possible to separate all of the problem formulation knowledge from the knowledge that is used to control the search.</p> <p>At an abstract level, a trace of the problem solving starts with the creation of the initial state and is followed by the selection and application of operators. To represent the states in the water jug problem, we will have two values: the amount of water in the five gallon jug, and the amount of water in the three gallon jug. For example: 5:0,3:0 will represent that the 5 gallon container has 0 gallons of water, and the 3 gallon container has 0 gallons of water. Below is a trace of the optimal solution for the problem showing the states and the operators that are applied to each state.</p> <pre><code>(5:0,3:0) Fill 3 gallon jug\n(5:0,3:3) Pour 3 gallon jug into 5 gallon jug\n(5:3,3:0) Fill 3 gallon jug\n(5:3,3:3) Pour 3 gallon jug into 5 gallon jug\n(5:5,3:1)\n</code></pre> <p>The rest of this section will take you through all of the steps of representing the problem in Soar, including determining the representation of the states in working memory, creating the initial state, representing the operators in rules (and working memory), and so on.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#state-representation","title":"State Representation","text":"<p>For tasks that involve interaction with the outside world, much of the state structure is determined by what comes in via perception. For the water jug problem, we could hook up Soar to a water jug simulator (or real world robot) and have it issue commands to pour water into and out of jugs, but to simplify learning Soar, we will have Soar solve the problem through the manipulation of internal data structures. . Moreover, this will prepare you for planning, where your program will need to create an internal representation of the problem even if there is an external world.</p> <p>What are the parts of the problem that must be represented on the state? There are really two types of information: dynamic information that changes during problem solving, such as how much water is in each jug, and static information that doesn\u2019t change, such as the size of each jug.</p> <p>So one state representation might include:</p> <ul> <li>The amount of water each jug currently holds.</li> <li>The amount of water each jug can hold.</li> </ul> <p>You can combine these together by having the volume of the jug as an attribute with the value being the current contents. Under this scheme, the initial state would look something like:</p> <pre><code>(state &lt;s&gt; ^five-gallon-jug-contents 0\n^three-gallon-jug-contents 0)\n</code></pre> <p>This is a very compact representation; however you will have to write very specific rules for proposing and applying operators. You will need one set of rules to propose the operators for the five-gallon jug and one for the three-gallon jug.</p> <p>A more general approach would be to represent each jug as an object that had two attributes:</p> <ul> <li>The amount of water each jug currently holds (^contents).</li> <li>The amount of water each jug can hold (^volume).</li> </ul> <p>In this scheme, the initial state would look something like this.</p> <pre><code>(state &lt;s&gt; ^jug &lt;j1&gt;\n  ^jug &lt;j2&gt;)\n(&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 5\n  ^contents 0)\n(&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 3\n  ^contents 0)\n</code></pre> <p>Note that jug is an attribute that can have multiple values at the same time. We call this a multi-valued attribute. Multi-valued attributes allow you to represent sets of objects, such as the set of two jugs.</p> <p>Using this representation, you can write one set of rules for manipulating both jugs. Although this representation is sufficient for defining and solving the problem, as you will see later, the rules to propose operators can be simplified if you add an attribute for the amount of water that can be added to a jug to fill it (^empty). As you will see later, the value of this augmentation can be computed dynamically using state elaboration rules that test the volume and contents augmentations and subtract the volume from the contents. Thus, states will include the following structures:</p> <ul> <li>An object for each jug (^jug).</li> <li>The amount of water each jug can hold (^volume).</li> <li>The amount of water each jug currently holds (^contents).</li> <li>The amount of empty space available in each jug (^empty).</li> </ul> <p>Although this representation is sufficient, one more working memory structure is extremely useful: a description of the task that is being attempted, in this case water-jug. By having some description of the task, the rules we create can be specific to that task and easily combined with rules from other tasks without interference. Thus, a common Soar convention is to label the state with information about the task being attempted. The simplest approach is to have a ^name attribute, where the value is the name of the task. For some tasks, other information is useful, but this will be sufficient for the water jug task.</p> <ul> <li>The task name (^name water-jug)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#initial-state-creation-the-initialize-water-jug-operator","title":"Initial State Creation: The initialize-water-jug Operator","text":"<p>In order for Soar to start on a problem, the structures of initial state must be in working memory. For tasks involving interaction with an external environment, much of the state will be created by the perceptual information that comes in from sensors. That information would be created on the input-link structure of the state. But for this task, we are assuming there is no external environment, so the initial state must be created by rules that you add to the system.</p> <p>Thus, the first step is to define an operator that will create the initial state. By using an operator instead of a single rule, the act of initialization is a choice that can be controlled \u2013 that is, the operator to initialize the problem will be proposed and a decision will be made whether to do it. If other tasks are possible, the agent can decide which task will be attempted by using control knowledge to pick among the different initialization operators.</p> <p>The first step in creating an operator is to write down the proposal rule in English.</p> <p>Type the English versions of the proposal and application rules for the initialize-water-jug operator. These versions will be documentation, so we have to tell Soar to ignore them. You can do this by starting each line with the pound-sign (\u201c#\u201d). Soar ignores lines that start with a pound sign.</p> <p>In Soar, the name of the rule can be almost any string of characters, but it is a good idea for it to be a meaningful summary of the purpose of the rule. A useful convention is to split the name into parts separated by asterisks (\u201c*\u201d). The first part is the task, the second part is the function (propose, apply, elaborate), and the third is the name of the operator. There may be additional parts for more details of what the rule does.</p> <p>As with every operator, we must define two types of rules: one to propose the operator and one to apply the operator. This operator should be proposed only at the beginning, before any task is selected. Thus, the proposal should be:</p> <pre><code>water-jug*propose*initialize-water-jug\n</code></pre> <p>If no task is selected, then propose the initialize-water-jug operator.</p> <p>Writing this rule in Soar is a challenge given what you know so far. How can you test that no task has been selected or that no jugs are defined? In Soar it is possible to test for the absence of working memory elements by preceding the attribute with \u201c-\u201c. Every rule in Soar must have at least one positive condition, so you still need to test that the state exists and in this case we use (^superstate nil).</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*initialize-water-jug\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate nil)\n    -(&lt;s&gt; ^name)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n  (&lt;o&gt; ^name initialize-water-jug)}\n</code></pre> <p>VisualSoar \u2013 The purpose of this production is to propose the operator that will initialize the water-jug. If you look at the operator window in VisualSoar you will see that the file at the bottom is titled \u201cinitialize-water-jug.\u201d This is created automatically when you created the water-jug project because a standard practice is to use an initialization operator for a new task. Either double-click on that file or right-click on the file and click Open Rules. This will open up a rule editor in which you will see two rules already partially written. The initialization written above is a very standard one, and because of this VisualSoar automatically creates a template of it for you (it is the first rule at the top). It may look a little different because VisualSoar uses a few shortcuts that you will learn later, feel free to leave it how it is or change it to the way it is above, it will not matter. Leave this rule window open.</p> <p>Just a reminder that the order of the conditions don\u2019t matter except that the first condition must be a positive test of the state. Thus, there is no difference between the above rule and one where the test for the absence of the jug comes before the absence of the name. Soar analyzes the rule and automatically reorders the conditions in order to improve the efficiency of matching the rules.</p> <p>The second condition will match only if there is not any working memory element on the state with attribute name. The condition does no test for a value, because it doesn\u2019t matter what the value is. You could include variables in the value position (such as ) if you wanted, and that would not change the meaning of the rule. <p>All the conditions test attributes of the same object (the state), and you can simplify the rule by combining these conditions (just as VisualSoar did) into a single structure where the identifier <code>(&lt;s&gt;)</code> is followed by the attributes:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*initialize-water-jug\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^type state\n\n-^name)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name initialize-water-jug)}\n</code></pre> <p>Soar automatically translates this structure into the one above.</p> <p>To apply the initialize-water-jug operator, we need another rule. The initialization application rule adds the name to the state and creates the jugs with contents of 0. The rule needs to add working memory elements for the initial values of the jugs and their attributes.</p> <pre><code>water-jug*apply*initialize-water-jug\n</code></pre> <p>If the initialize water-jug operator is selected, then create an empty 5 gallon jug and an empty 3 gallon jug.</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*apply*initialize-water-jug\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name initialize-water-jug)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^jug &lt;j1&gt;\n^jug &lt;j2&gt;)\n(&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 5\n^contents 0)\n(&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 3\n^contents 0)}\n</code></pre> <p>This rule does not include the creation of the ^empty attribute \u2013 it will be created by another rule that dynamically computes it based on the volume and contents (see Section 4.5).</p> <p>VisualSoar \u2013 In the initialize-water-jug rule window you will notice that VisualSoar has attempted to write this rule for you also. The application of initializing the water-jug is not as standard as the proposal and VisualSoar is not able to initialize all of the attributes that this project will need. Modify the second rule in the rule window to match the rule above.</p> <p>Now, at the top of VisualSoar, click on Datamap | Check All Productions Against the Datamap. In the feedback window at the bottom you will see a list of blue warnings. What you just did was make VisualSoar check all of your rules to see if they matched the Datamap for this project. Recall that the Datamap is a representation of the structure of working memory. Since you just added new augmentations to the state in your rule, but not to the Datamap, warnings are created. To fix this, right-click in the operator window on \u201cwater-jug\u201d and click on Open Datamap so that now you have the Datamap and initialize-water-jug windows open. You will notice that VisualSoar has already included the structure for the Initialize-water-jug operator \u2013 this is automatically created whenever a new operator is added to the operator set. The Datamap is a hierarchical structure that looks like folders and files as in the operator window, but it is really the structure of working memory. The folders are used to represent working memory elements (such as operator) whose values are identifiers, and thus can have substructure. The file-like structures are attributes that have constants as values \u2013 either sets of symbols (enumeration), integers, floating point numbers (floats), or strings. You must now add entries into the Datamap for the water-jug state structure.</p> <p>What you need to add to the Datamap are the jug structures that are created by initialize-water-jug and that will be used by the remaining operator. In order to add a new attribute to the Datamap, you start by right clicking on the \u201cwater-jug\u201d folder in the Datamap (not in the operator window). The water-jug folder in the Datamap represents the top-state structure in Soar. After right-clicking, a menu will appear that let\u2019s you select the type of value that will be associated with the attribute you are creating. Since the jug attribute will have an identifier as its value, select \u201cAdd Identifier \u2026\u201d</p> <p>You will then be prompted for the attribute name. Type in \u201cjug\u201d.</p> <p>This will add the jug structure to the Datamap. You can now right click on the jug structure, and select \u201cAdd Integer \u2026\u201d to add the contents attribute to the jug structure. Type in the name, and then repeat this for the empty and volume attributes. If the attribute had values that were different possible symbols, you would use the \u201cAdd Enumeration \u2026\u201d selection. Your screen should now look like this:</p> <p>Now have VisualSoar check all productions against the Datamap (using the command under the Datamap tab in the toolbar), you should have no errors. Make sure to save and feel free to close the Datamap and initialize-water-jug windows.</p> <p>In the above rule, the variable  is used to connect the first condition to the second. To simplify the writing and reading of rules, Soar allows you to combine conditions that are linked by variables. To do this, you can just string together attributes, replacing the intermediate variables with a period, \u201c.\u201d, to separate the attributes. In Soar, we call this \u201cdot\u201d or \u201cpath\u201d notation. Below is the same rule as before using dot notation. <pre><code>sp {water-jug*apply*initialize-water-jug\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name initialize-water-jug)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n    ^jug &lt;j1&gt;\n    ^jug &lt;j2&gt;)\n  (&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 5\n    ^contents 0)\n  (&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 3\n    ^contents 0)}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#persistence-of-working-memory-elements","title":"Persistence of Working Memory Elements","text":"<p>When the water-jugapplyinitialize-water-jug rule fires, all of the structures in its action are added to working memory. At this point, it would be desirable for the initialize-water-jug operator to be removed from working memory so that other operators can be selected. This is exactly what Soar does because the conditions of the proposal rule no longer match (the conditions testing for the absence of a task and the absence of the jug augmentation fail to match because those structures have been added to working memory). Once that rule retracts, the rule that applied the operator also no longer matches because the operator is no longer in working memory. However, we do not want the application rule to remove the structures it created when it no longer matches. If it did, the system would never be able to make any real progress \u2013 it would get in an infinite loop of proposing and applying an operator, retracting its results, and then proposing and applying the operator again.</p> <p>In order to support the different needs of different problem solving functions (in this case operator proposal and operator application), Soar makes a distinction between the persistence of working memory elements created by operator application rules and the persistence of working memory elements created by other types of rules. Operator application needs to create persistent results because operators are the deliberate commitments that the system has made \u2013 it has decided to apply the operator and make potentially non-monotonic changes to the state \u2013 to move itself to a new state in the problem space. All other rules in Soar compute the entailments/elaborations of the current state without actually changing it and should be retracted when they no longer match the current state. This is a very important feature of Soar \u2013 it makes a distinction between knowledge that modifies the current state (knowledge in operator applications), and knowledge that just computes the entailments of the current situation (including which operators should be considered for the current state).</p> <p>Soar automatically classifies rules as to whether they are part of an operator application or not. A rule is an operator application rule if it tests the selected operator and modifies the state. The working memory elements created by such a rule persist and are said to have operator-support, or o-support because they are created as part of an operator. These working memory elements can be removed by other operator applications rules (this type of removal has yet to be introduced in the tutorial), or if they become disconnected from the state (because of the removal of other working memory elements).</p> <p>For non-operator application rules, including rules that propose an operator, rules that compare operators, rules that elaborate operators, or rules that elaborate the state, the working memory elements created by the rules are removed from working memory if the rule no longer matches. These working memory elements are said to have instantiation-support or i-support \u2013 meaning they will persist only as long as the rule instantiation that created them still matches.</p> <p>We will examine the persistence of working memory elements in more detail when we create the rules for the Water Jug, but this is a fundamental and sometimes difficult part of Soar for people to learn. It differentiates Soar from most other rule-based systems that don\u2019t have rules that automatically retract their results when they no longer match and it gives Soar its own Truth-Maintenance System (TMS).</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#water-jug-state-elaboration","title":"Water Jug State Elaboration","text":"<p>The initialization operator creates jugs that include the volume and content. As mentioned earlier, it will be useful for each jug to include the amount of additional water that can be added to it before it is full. Although this could be created by the initialization operator, it would have to be maintained by every operator application and that would make the operator application rules more complex. An alternative is to compute the available volume for each jug in the state with a separate rule. This rule will test the state and create a new structure on the state. This type of rule is called a state elaboration rule. State elaboration rules are ubiquitous in large Soar systems because they can create useful abstractions of combinations of other working memory elements and represent them directly on the state as a new augmentation. These new augmentations can then be tested in other rules in place of complex combinations of conditions, simplifying rules and making the structures in working memory more meaningful. A critical aspect of state elaboration rules is that they create i-supported working memory elements so that when the parts of the state they test change, they recompute their actions automatically.</p> <p>For the Water Jug problem, the state elaboration will compute the amount of empty space in a jug:</p> <pre><code>water-jug*elaborate*empty\n</code></pre> <p>If the state is named water-jug and a jug can hold volume v and currently has contents c, then add that it has v \u2013 c available (empty) space.</p> <p>The first condition that it tests is that the state is named water-jug, so that it will only apply for water-jug problems. This test will be included in all of the water jug rules. It then tests that there is a jug and adds an appropriate empty attribute. Translating the conditions of this rule to Soar is straightforward. We have to include conditions for the jug, its volume and its contents.</p> <p>The action requires adding a new attribute to the jug (thus using the same variable as matched in the condition, <code>&lt;j&gt;</code>) and then computing the value by doing some math. In Soar, all math is done using prefix notation where the math operations <code>(+, -, *, /)</code> come before the arguments, with parentheses surrounding the computation. For example, if the value was going to be the sum of <code>&lt;v&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;c&gt;</code>, you would put <code>(+ &lt;v&gt; &lt;c&gt;)</code> where the value should be (right after the <code>^empty</code> attribute). You can nest operations using additional parentheses, such as <code>(+ 2 (* &lt;v&gt; &lt;c&gt;))</code> to add 2 to the product of <code>&lt;v&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;c&gt;</code>, but for this case, nesting is not necessary. See if you can write the rule yourself before looking below:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*elaborate*empty\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n    ^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n  (&lt;j&gt; ^volume &lt;v&gt;\n    ^contents &lt;c&gt;)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;j&gt; ^empty (- &lt;v&gt; &lt;c&gt;))}\n</code></pre> <p>When the contents of a jug changes through an operator application rule, this rule will retract the old value of ^empty and fire to compute a new value.</p> <p>VisualSoar \u2013 This rule is an elaboration. VisualSoar has a folder named elaborations in the operator window to hold files for state elaborations. Right-click on this folder and click \u201cAdd a File\u2026\u201d. You will see a text box pop-up. In the Name category type \u201cempty\u201d and click OK. Expand the elaborations folder and you should see the file you just created and two default files named \u201c_all\u201d and \u201ctop-state.\u201d These files are provided for all Soar programs and have a few simple rules that are useful for tasks with substates. You should now open the \u201cempty\u201d file by double clicking on it. You can add the rule from scratch and just type it in, or you can use a template. To use a template, click on Insert Template in the toolbar and select elaborate-state. That will give you the basic structure of an elaboration rule.

There really is no way to say that one is more important than another, and in Soar, we attempt to avoid decisions when we really don\u2019t have to make them, so in Soar, all rules that newly match fire at the same time, in parallel. Of course the Soar program is running on a serial computer (usually), so it isn\u2019t really in parallel, but for all intents and purposes, the rules fire in parallel. This is very different than most programming languages and can be confusing (and liberating) because you will find that rules fire as soon as they match.</p> <p>Below is a more complete look at Soar\u2019s basic cycle. For this problem there is no input and output, so those boxes are skipped. Starting at the left, rules fire (or retract) that elaborate the state or propose operators. There might be multiple rules firing (or retracting) in parallel, and the results of one rule firing (or retraction) might lead to additional rules firing (or retracting), and Soar continues to fire these waves of rules until there are no new firings (or retractions). Once there are no more rules to fire (or retract), quiescence is reached and the decision procedure is entered to select the operator. This approach guarantees that when a decision is made, all of the available knowledge from rules is available.</p> <p>After the operator is selected, rules that apply the operator can fire. Operator application will usually lead to firing and retracting of state elaboration and operator proposal rules and that will also happen during the operator application phase. When that phase reaches quiescence, output and then input are processed followed by the first phase described above. In tasks where there is an external environment, many operators require action in the world, and so changes to the state will appear during input. In the water jug task, all state changes happen in operator application, so that the elaborate state and propose operator phase do not lead to additional rule firings after the first time through the cycle.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#water-jug-operator-proposals","title":"Water Jug Operator Proposals","text":"<p>In the Water Jug problem, there are three operators: fill, empty, and pour.

These conditions will be the basis for the operator proposals.</p> <ul> <li>Fill a jug with water from the well, if that the jug is not full.</li> <li>Empty the water from a jug to the well, if there is water in the     jug.</li> <li>Pour water from one jug to another jug, if there is water in the     source jug and the destination jug is not full.</li> </ul> <p>Although one could attempt to fill a jug that is already full; in Soar, operators must change the state in some way so that another operator can be selected. Thus, in our formulation, filling a full jug must be disallowed. Now write English descriptions of the proposals.</p> <pre><code>water-jug*propose*fill\n</code></pre> <p>If the task is water-jug and there is a jug that is not full, then propose filling that jug.</p> <pre><code>water-jug*propose*empty\n</code></pre> <p>If the task is water-jug and there is a jug that is not empty, then propose emptying that jug.</p> <pre><code>water-jug*propose*pour\n</code></pre> <p>If the task is water-jug and there is a jug that is not full and the other jug is not empty, then propose pouring water from the second jug into the first jug.</p> <p>Each of these rules can potentially match either one of the jugs.</p> <p>In translating these rules into Soar, we need to write the tests in the conditions, but we also need to write actions that will create the operator. The hello-world and initialization operators were just a name; however, with these new operators, you want to have some parameters that specify which jugs are being filled, emptied, or poured. If you really wanted to, you could encode everything in the name of the operators, but then we would need six different operators, such as \u201cfill-jug-three\u201d or \u201cpour-jug-five-into-jug-three\u201d, and this would require separate rules to apply each of those operators. Instead, by having parameters with the operators, you can have fewer rules that apply the appropriate changes to the state. For this task, a set of operator parameters and possible labels are listed below:</p> <ul> <li>The name of the operator: <code>^name fill/empty/pour</code>.</li> <li>The jug that is being filled by the fill operator: <code>^fill-jug &lt;j&gt;</code>.</li> <li>The jug that is being emptied by the empty operator: <code>^empty-jug &lt;j&gt;</code>.</li> <li>The jug that is being poured out of by pour: <code>^empty-jug &lt;j1&gt;</code>.</li> <li>The jug being poured into by pour: <code>^fill-jug &lt;j2&gt;</code>.</li> </ul> <p>For example, with this representation, the operator representation for pouring from jug <code>&lt;j1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;j2&gt;</code> would be:</p> <pre><code>(&lt;o&gt; ^name pour\n^empty-jug &lt;j1&gt;\n^fill-jug &lt;j2&gt;)\n</code></pre> <p>There are lots of other possibilities and it is not necessary to share the name of the parameters between the pour operators and the others.</p> <p>Now try to write the first proposal as a Soar rule for proposing fill.

Using what you know already, one way to write this rule is:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*fill\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n(&lt;j&gt; -^empty 0)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name fill\n^fill-jug &lt;j&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>This rule tests that jug <code>&lt;j&gt;</code> does not have an empty augmentation of 0. This is a double negative, and although correct in the context of what has been written, it is difficult to understand. An alternative is to test that the ^empty augmentation has a value greater than 0. Soar supports simple tests in conditions including greater than (&gt;), greater than or equal (&gt;=), less than (&lt;), less than or equal (&lt;=), and not equal (&lt;&gt;). The tests are associated with the value (or variable) that follows them. So an alternative way to write this rule is:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*fill\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n(&lt;j&gt; ^empty &gt; 0)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name fill\n^fill-jug &lt;j&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>Another alternative condition would be to replace the test of empty being greater than zero with a test that the contents don\u2019t equal the volume: (<code>&lt;j&gt; ^volume &lt;v&gt; ^contents &lt;&gt; &lt;v&gt;</code>).</p> <p>One alternative that is not possible is to do some simple math in the conditions to test whether the volume minus the contents equal 0. Soar does not allow any math in conditions \u2013 you should use elaborations instead so that the math is always done in actions.</p> <p>VisualSoar \u2013 If you look in the operator window in VisualSoar, you will not see anything relating to a \u201cfill\u201d operator . You need to create a new operator file that will hold all of the rules related to fill. To do this, right-click on \u201cwater-jug\u201d in the operator window and click on \u201cAdd a Suboperator\u2026\u201d, name it \u201cfill\u201d and click OK. Open the newly created fill operator and add the rule above (using the propose operator templates).</p> <p>When finished adding the rule, open the Datamap. You will notice that an operator structure for fill has automatically been created, but you need to add empty-jug as an attribute. The value for empty-jug is an identifier, but it is really the same structure as a jug on the state. So instead of creating a new empty-jug structure from scratch, we want to create a \u201clink\u201d from empty-jug to the state jug structure. Note, we don\u2019t want a copy of the jug structure, because if the jug substructure changes, we want those changes reflected in the empty-jug structure. To create the link is the \u201ctrickiest\u201d operation in VisualSoar. First, left-click and hold (don\u2019t let up on the left-mouse button!) on the \u201cjug\u201d structure on the state. Then with drag that structure onto the fill operator structure in the Datamap. If you let up on the button now, it would move the jug structure, but we want to create a link. To do that, hold down the \u201cctrl\u201d and \u201cshift\u201d keys (usually with your left hand). This should make a new icon appear that has a little arrow (see diagram below). Then let up on the mouse button (while keeping \u201cctrl\u201d and \u201cshift\u201d down. This will create an attribute of the operator with name \u201cjug\u201d. (Note: sometimes the display of the Datamap in VisualSoar is not correctly updated. You might need to close the Datamap and reopen it for it to refresh correctly).</p> <p>At this point, you should rename the attribute. Do this by right-clicking on the attribute, and then select \u201cRename Attribute \u2026\u201d from the menu. Type in \u201cfill-jug\u201d and then click OK.</p> <p>Now try to write the proposal for emptying a jug. This requires only minimal changes to the previous rule, changing the test that a jug is not full to a test that the jug is not empty.</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*empty\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n(&lt;j&gt; ^contents &gt; 0)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name empty\n^empty-jug &lt;j&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>VisualSoar \u2013 This is very similar to before. Add a suboperator (just like \u201cfill\u201d) called \u201cempty\u201d to water-jug, type in the rule, and create the Datamap entries for it.</p> <p>Writing the third proposal for pour requires a test that one jug is not empty (so it can have water poured from it) and the other jug is not full (so water can pour into it). You might think that this is a simple combination of the tests in the previous two rules so that the rule should be:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*pour\\*wrong\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^jug &lt;i&gt;\n^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n(&lt;i&gt; ^contents &gt; 0)\n(&lt;j&gt; ^empty &gt; 0)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name pour\n^empty-jug &lt;i&gt;\n^fill-jug &lt;j&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>This rule is not correct because the tests for jug <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and jug <code>&lt;j&gt;</code> can match the same jug. That is because there is nothing in Soar that prevents different conditions from matching the same working memory element. For example, if working memory holds <code>(s1 ^jug j1)</code> <code>(j1 ^contents 3 ^empty 2 ^volume 5)</code>, this rule would create a proposal for a pour operator that would pour from jug j1 to itself because it would successfully match the conditions for both <code>&lt;j&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>. To correct this rule, the conditions must be modified so the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;j&gt;</code> can not match the same identifier, that is, that <code>&lt;j&gt;</code> is not equal to <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>. That test in Soar is <code>&lt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;</code>. But where should that test be added in the rule? In Soar, multiple tests of a value (and multiple tests for an identifier or attribute) can be specified by surrounding all of the tests with curly brackets: { \u2026 }. In this case, we can combine the test for <code>&lt;j&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;</code> to be <code>{&lt;j&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;}</code>. This demonstrates both the use of curly brackets and the use of not equals. Note that the test could also be <code>{ &lt;&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;j&gt; }</code> and it would mean exactly the same thing \u2013 what matches in this position cannot equal <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and must equal <code>&lt;j&gt;</code>.</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*pour\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^jug &lt;i&gt;\n^jug { &lt;j&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;i&gt; })\n(&lt;i&gt; ^contents &gt; 0)\n(&lt;j&gt; ^empty &gt; 0)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name pour\n^empty-jug &lt;i&gt;\n^fill-jug &lt;j&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>VisualSoar \u2013 Once again this is very similar to before. Add a suboperator (just like \u201cfill\u201d) called \u201cpour\u201d to water-jug, type in the rule, and add the Datamap entries for it.</p> <p>Now that you have all of the proposals written, you can load them in with your other rules. What happens when you run them? You will see that only <code>water-jug*propose*fill</code> matches in the initial state. It fires twice since it matches both jugs, right after ^empty is added to each jug. What happens next? When Soar does not have enough knowledge to select between the two operators, it has a tie impasse and it automatically creates a substate where it can do reflective problem solving to decide what to do next. We will cover substates in a later section. For now, we just want Soar to select randomly between these operators. You can tell Soar that it doesn\u2019t matter which operator is selected by creating an indifferent preference, using \u201c=\u201d for the operator. This can be created in the same rule that proposes the operator.</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*fill\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n(&lt;j&gt; ^empty &gt; 0)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +\n^operator &lt;o&gt; =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name fill\n^fill-jug &lt;j&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>The two actions for <code>^operator</code> can be shortened by using just: <code>(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)</code></p> <p>which means create an acceptable and indifferent preference (you always need the acceptable preference, even if there are other preferences created). You should modify all of the operator proposals to include the = preference.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#operator-application","title":"Operator Application","text":"<p>The next step is to write the operator application rules that will fire once an operator is selected. In the Water Jug problem, your rules apply operators by adding and removing working memory elements to reflect the pouring of the water.</p> <p>What keeps the operator application productions from applying over and over again? When the operator rules apply, they change the part of the state either directly (through rules that change working memory) or indirectly (by doing some action in the world that changes what the Soar agent perceives \u2013 more on that in later sections). These changes will cause the acceptable preference for the selected operator to retract because at least one of the working memory elements that matched the proposal rule changed. The changes to working memory will cause new matches of proposal rules, which will be followed by the selection of a new operator, its application, and so on.</p> <p>Given the state representation used in this problem, there are two different ways that the operators can change the state representation. The most straightforward is to add and delete the ^contents attributes of the jug objects. However, the operators could also remove a jug and create a completely new jug object with the correct contents and volume attributes. Although this is less efficient, it has some advantages for planning and we will return to this approach in Part IV. For now you should write operator application rules that modify the ^contents attribute of the jug objects (it is not necessary to modify the ^empty attribute because it will be automatically recomputed whenever the ^contents change).</p> <p>In the Water Jug, there are three separate operators and each one requires its own operator application rules. We will examine them one at a time. The first is fill. Try to write an English version of its operator application rule.</p> <pre><code>water-jug*apply*fill\n</code></pre> <p>If the task is water-jug and the fill operator is selected for a given jug, then set that jug\u2019s contents to be its volume.</p> <p>This rule requires replacing the current value of the contents with a new value (the volume). To replace a value in Soar, you must remove the original working memory element and create a new one. There is no way to just replace the value field in an existing working memory element. This is an important attribute of Soar \u2013 all changes require the addition or deletion of working memory elements. You cannot modify a working memory element once it is created. You already know how to create a working memory element. To delete one, you specify the working memory element in the action but with a minus \u201c-\u201c at the end.</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*apply*fill\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n^operator &lt;o&gt;\n^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name fill\n^fill-jug &lt;j&gt;)\n(&lt;j&gt; ^volume &lt;volume&gt;\n^contents &lt;contents&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;j&gt; ^contents &lt;volume&gt;)\n(&lt;j&gt; ^contents &lt;contents&gt; -)}\n</code></pre> <p>VisualSoar \u2013 In VisualSoar, we group all of the rules for an operator in a single file.

One situation is where pouring the water into the jug being filled can hold all of the water being poured in, such as pouring from the three gallon jug into an empty five gallon jug. The other situation is where the jug being filled cannot hold all of the water, so that some water is left in the source jug, such as when pouring from the full five gallon jug into an empty three gallon jug.

Since it tests the initialize-water-jug operator, it naturally should be added to the folder that holds that operator. Remember, how you group your rules is completely up to you. It makes sense to think of grouping in VisualSoar as an advanced way to comment code: it doesn\u2019t affect the way the code is interpreted by the computer, but if you or anyone else ever has to alter the code, it will make it much easier to understand. From here on out, it is up to you to choose how you want to group your code.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#search-control","title":"Search Control","text":"<p>In order to make the search more efficient; you need to add rules that prefer operators that have the best chance of leading to one of the desired states. There are few general heuristics that you can use in the water jug. The total number of possible states is only 16; however, they are highly connected, and it is difficult to avoid revisiting the same state over and over again unless a list of visited states is maintained. Maintaining such a list is possible in Soar, but it is not easy \u2013 it would require creating a copy of every state after an operator has applied and then comparing a new state to the states in the list. In the section on planning you will learn about an alternative approach that is a more natural way for Soar programs to avoid repeated visits to the same state. For now, we will concentrate on avoiding undoing the last operator that was applied, such as emptying a jug right after it has been filled, filling a jug after it has been emptied, or pouring water from one jug into the other right after the opposite pouring has been done. These heuristics will be even more effective when for the Missionaries and Cannibals problem and planning, but for now they allow us to look at how to maintain a history of the last operator application.</p> <p>In order to avoid undoing the last operator, the program must remember the operator in the state after it applies. In Soar, this memory is not automatic. The selected operator is retracted as soon as it applies. In order to have a record of the previous operator; you must add some rules that deliberately record the operator each time one is applied. The rules will be part of the operator application because they will test the operator in order to record it, which in turn will make the record persistent (which is what you want).</p> <p>Recording an operator has two parts. The first is creating a structure on the state that is the memory of the most recent operator. The second is removing any record of an older operator. Given the representation of the water jug operators in working memory, you will have to write three rules to record the last operator \u2013 one for each operator. If all of the operators had exactly the same augmentations, then it would be possible to do this with one rule, and we could change the operator representations to make this easy, but for now, we will go with the existing operator representations. The action of these rules should be to create an augmentation of the state that includes the augmentation of the selected operator (name, fill-jug, empty-jug as appropriate).

For example, you could define the problem of starting with both jugs full and getting four gallons of water into the five-gallon jug. Should that problem be easier or harder than the original problem? The difficulty can also vary with the definition of the problem space. The original problem becomes easy if we expand the problem space to include a jug that holds four gallons of water (changing the objects in the space), and it becomes impossible if there is no pour operator.</p> <p>One way to understand the Water Jug problems better is to visualize the complete problem space. The diagram below shows all the states and operator transitions in the Water Jug problem space. Each state contains the contents of the five-gallon and three-gallon jugs in order. The operator transitions are color coded. The goal states are shared in light green. In this problem, there are two distinct paths to the solution, one path much shorter (4 steps) than the other path (10 steps). The difficulty of the problem stems from the fact that there are usually four operators that can apply to each state but only one leads toward the solution. The remaining operators lead back toward one of four states, all of which are at least three steps from the solution. Therefore it is unlikely that this problem will be solved quickly via a random search.</p> <p>Although we can layout the complete problem space and the connections between states, the problem solver usually doesn\u2019t have that information available for examination \u2013 it only has the information available in a single state. For the purposes of this tutorial, we assumed that the agent starts with only an internal description of the initial state, the set of legal operators, and the desired state so that the problem will be solved by starting from the initial state and then searching for a desired state by selecting and applying operators. At any time the agent is at only one state and is faced with selecting an operator to apply to the state to move to a new state. Often AI planners reformulate problems so that they are searching through a space of plans (and not states of the problem). In those cases, the states are partial plans and the operators modify the plan by adding, removing, or reordering plan steps. For the problems we consider in this tutorial, the problem solver will always be in the space of states of the problem (task states) and not in a planning space (although you could use Soar to work in the planning space, but it would complicate the description of Soar).</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/01/#summary-of-problem-formulation-in-soar","title":"Summary of Problem Formulation in Soar","text":"<p>Below is a summary of the main steps in formulating and representing a problem in Soar.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The state representation.

Rules such as propose*move-north maintain their actions in working memory only as long as they match exactly the same working memory elements.</p> <p>Second, a new instance of the move-north operator will be created because propose*move-north will match the new values of x and y and fire. To see these changes, modify your move-north operator as above and then rerun it. This time, we are going to increase the tracing so that we can see the individual changes to working memory. To do this, type <code>watch 4 --timetags</code> in the interaction window.</p> <p>The figure below shows the end of the trace. The trace is long because it includes the addition and removal of all of the sensory data that changes during a move (not shown below). In the trace, an addition to working memory is shown preceded by an <code>=&gt;</code>, while a removal from working memory is preceded by an <code>&lt;=</code>. Each working memory element also contains a number, such as 119 for the top element in the trace below. This is the timetag of the working memory element \u2013 a unique number generated when a working element is created. Soar sometimes displays only timetags instead of the full working memory element, and the timetag can be used in the print and wmes commands for displaying the full working memory element (more details later).</p> <p>Your eater will now move north a second time (and a third, etc, if not blocked) because the proposal matches against a new set of x and y coordinates, apply*move fires again, and a second move command is created. But there are still problems. Step the eater a few more times and then choose the \u201coutput\u201d tab on the upper right section of the eater Debugger window to see the eater\u2019s ^output-link. You will notice that the original move command (I3 ^move M2) is not removed from the output-link, and the output-link will gradually accumulate stale commands. The old move command is not removed because it is the action of an operator application rule. Such actions are not automatically removed when the rule no longer matches.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/02/#operator-application-persistence","title":"Operator Application: Persistence","text":"<p>As noted above, proposing and selecting a second operator makes the eater move a second time, but the accumulation of more and more move commands will eventually become a problem. Why aren\u2019t these commands automatically removed like the preferences for operators? The reason is that the rule that creates them is part of the application of an operator, and operator applications create persistent working memory elements.</p> <p>Persistence is necessary for creating memories of prior events, such as the memory of something sensed in the environment. For example, if an eater needed to remember the location of uneaten food so that it could return to it later, the eater would have to create a persistent structure in its working memory. Otherwise, as soon as it stopped sensing the food, it would forget about it. In Soar, all working memory elements created by an operator application rule are persistent. A rule is an operator application rule if it tests a selected operator and modifies the state. Persistent working memory elements are said to be operator-supported, or o-supported, because they are created by operators. For example, apply*move-north is an operator application rule and creates o-supported working memory elements.</p> <pre><code>sp {apply*move-north\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name move-north\n^io.output-link &lt;out&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;out&gt; ^move.direction north)}\n</code></pre> <p>Just as it is important to have persistent memories, it is also important to have structures that are removed automatically when the reason for creating them goes away. Actions of rules that test only the state, or that test the operator and elaborate only the operator create non-persistent preferences or working memory elements. Obvious examples of non-persistent structures are the preferences for operators. These are created by operator proposal rules, which retract the operators when the proposal conditions change. Other examples include state elaboration rules and operator elaboration rules. Non-persistent working memory elements and preferences are called instantiation-supported, or i-supported, because they only persist as long as the rule instantiation that created them. For example, proposemove-north is not an operator application rule because it does not test a selected operator. All of its actions are i-supported and they will be removed from working memory when proposemove-north no longer matches.</p> <pre><code>sp {propose*move-north\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.eater &lt;e&gt;)\n(&lt;e&gt; ^x &lt;x&gt; ^y &lt;y&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move-north)}\n</code></pre> <p>Returning to the problem of moving the eater, you need to add a rule that removes old move commands from the output-link after the move is finished. In Eaters, the output system creates an augmentation on the move object after the action has executed: ^status complete. To remove a structure from working memory, a rule \u201crejects\u201d a working memory element in its action. A reject must be part of an operator application rule because it is a persistent change to working memory. Therefore, the removal must test the move-north operator so that it is an operator application rule. In English, the rule is:</p> <pre><code># Apply*move-north*remove-move:\n# If the move-north operator is selected,\n# and there is a completed move command on the output link,\n# then remove that command.\n</code></pre> <p>In Soar, the action of a rule can remove a working memory element by following it by a reject preference, which is designated with a minus sign (\u201c-\u201c). The above rule is translated in to Soar as follows:</p> <pre><code>sp {apply*move-north*remove-move\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name move-north\n^io.output-link &lt;out&gt;)\n(&lt;out&gt; ^move &lt;move&gt;)\n(&lt;move&gt; ^status complete)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;out&gt; ^move &lt;move&gt; -)}\n</code></pre> <p>The action of this rule removes the working memory element specified by <code>(&lt;out&gt; ^move &lt;move&gt;)</code>, which would be something like <code>(i3 ^move m1)</code>. When this working memory element is removed, all of the augmentations of m1 are automatically removed because they are no longer linked to the rest of working memory. In this case, <code>(m1 ^direction north)</code> and <code>(m1 ^status complete)</code> are removed. These would not be removed if they remained linked via another working memory element that had m1 as a value.</p> <p>This is an operator application rule, so it will not fire during the following operator proposal phase. Instead, it will fire during the next operator application phase, after a new move-north operator has been selected. It will not interfere with other operator application rules because rules fire (and retract) in parallel as a wave. The parallelism is only simulated, but the effect is as if all the rules fire or retract at the same time. Once a wave of rules has fired, their actions may cause additional rules to match or retract. Soar will continue to fire or retract additional waves of rules until no more rules match. Thus, within the phases of proposing and applying operators, Soar fires all rules that match until quiescence, that is, until no more rules match. During the propose phase, only rules that have i-supported actions will fire. During the apply phase, both o-supported and i-supported rules fire.</p> <p>Returning to our diagram of the phases of Soar, both the propose operator and apply operator phases can be expanded to show that multiple rules fire and retract in parallel until quiescence.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/02/#running-and-tracing","title":"Running and Tracing","text":"<p>When running your new eater, it will go north until it hits a wall or the border.

Below is a sample trace, with the <code>watch 3 --timetags</code> in use, of the interaction window for the first two moves to the north by an eater.</p> <p>If you look closely at this trace, you see that two rules are firing at the same time: apply*move-north, and apply*move-north*remove-move. One is adding the new move command to the output-link at the same time that the other is removing the previous move command. There are also examples of rules firing and retracting at the same time where an operator is being removed from working memory at the same time that a new operator is being created.</p> <p>Instead of letting Soar run free, you can step Soar through each decision using the \u201cStep\u201d button on either the Soar Debugger or the Java Eaters window.

It\u2019s possible to change the location where Soar will stop when stepping, using the Soar Cycle widget in the Debugger.</p> <p>The red icon in the diagram shows the point where Soar will stop when the Step button is used.

The Eaters Info window shows what an eater can sense. For this eater, you will write an operator that moves the eater to one of the neighboring cells (north, east, south, or west) that contains normalfood or bonusfood. Since food can be in more than one of the neighboring cells, more than one operator may be proposed. Soar does not automatically select randomly from among a set of proposed operators \u2013 it will get a tie impasse if there are multiple operators with only acceptable preferences. To avoid ties, Soar has additional preferences. For this exercise, it does not matter which food an eater consumes first, so you can use a preference that makes the decision procedure arbitrarily select one of the proposed operators.</p> <p>Based on the above discussion, you will need four rules for the move-to-food operator.</p> <ul> <li> <p>You need one rule to propose the operator when there is normal-food     in a neighboring cell and a second rule to propose the operator when     bonus-food is in a neighboring cell.

The indifferent preference means that the     decision procedure can randomly select among all operators with     indifferent preferences, so it is important that all proposed     operators have indifferent preferences. Even though we will create     an indifferent preference for these operators, the acceptable     preference is still necessary and an operator will not be selected     if it does not have an acceptable preference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Input-link representation. The input-link has two augmentations:     eater and my-location. Remember that the value of the my-location     augmentation is the eater\u2019s current position and is a cell in middle     of the 5x5 Eaters Info sensory field. On the next page there is a     graphic depiction of this cell and all of the other cells in the     sensory field. Adjacent cells are augmentations labeled north, east,     south, and west. Every cell also has a ^content augmentation, whose     value can be wall, empty, eater, normalfood, or bonusfood. If the     cell has an eater in it, there will be additional augmentations (not     shown in the figure) for the color of the eater (^eater-color), and     the eater\u2019s current score (^eater-score).

The alternative values are written in the same position as a single value, but are surrounded by double angle brackets: &lt;&lt; normalfood bonusfood &gt;&gt;. Any number of different values can be included, but none of them can be a variable.

It should not propose moving into a wall. There are two possible approaches to write this test. The first is to test all of the content values that are ok to move into: normalfood, bonusfood, eater, or empty. The second is to test that the content does not equal wall. Taking the first approach gives us the following English version of the proposal:</p> <pre><code># Propose*move*1:\n# If there is normalfood, bonusfood, eater, or empty in an adjacent cell,\n# propose move in the direction of that cell\n# and indicate that this operator can be selected randomly.\n</code></pre> <p>It is straightforward to translate this into Soar based on the move-to-food operator proposal:</p> <pre><code>sp {propose*move*1\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.my-location.&lt;dir&gt;.content\n\n&lt;&lt; empty normalfood bonusfood eater &gt;&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n^direction &lt;dir&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>Although this is adequate, it will make future selection rules simpler if the operator also contains the contents of the cell. Thus, an alternative version is:</p> <pre><code># Propose*move*1a:\n# If there is normalfood, bonusfood, eater, or empty in an adjacent cell,\n# propose move in the direction of that cell, with the cell\u2019s content,\n# and indicate that this operator can be selected randomly.\n</code></pre> <p>To translate this into Soar requires matching the cell\u2019s content to a variable and then using that variable in the action as an augmentation of the operator, such as <code>^content &lt;content&gt;</code>. However, the value is already matched by &lt;&lt; empty normalfood bonusfood eater &gt;&gt;. What is needed is a way to match both a variable and the list at the same time. In Soar this is done by surrounding the two (or more) things to match against the same item with curly braces: \u201c{ }\u201d. Thus, the Soar version of the proposal becomes:</p> <pre><code>sp {propose*move*1a\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.my-location.&lt;dir&gt;.content\n{ &lt;content&gt; &lt;&lt; empty normalfood bonusfood eater &gt;&gt; })\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n^direction &lt;dir&gt;\n^content &lt;content&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>Although this rule is adequate, it forces you to list all of the contents except walls. This rule will have to be changed if we ever add other types of food (e.g., superbonusfood). It might be better to write a rule that tests that the content is not equal to wall. This can be done in Soar by using \u201c&lt;&gt;\u201d. The not equal test can also be combined with the variable as in propose*move*1a, giving the following rule:</p> <pre><code>sp {propose*move*2a\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.my-location.&lt;dir&gt;.content\n{ &lt;content&gt; &lt;&gt; wall })\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n^direction &lt;dir&gt;\n^content &lt;content&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>The \u201c&lt;&gt;\u201d must be placed directly before the value it compares, and in the example above, it is correctly before wall. The rule can also be written with the variable after the test that the content is not equal to wall:</p> <pre><code>sp {propose*move*2a\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.my-location.&lt;dir&gt;.content\n{ &lt;&gt; wall &lt;content&gt; })\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n^direction &lt;dir&gt;\n^content &lt;content&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>The not equal test can also be used with variables. For example, if you want to test that the content of the cells to the north and south of the eater are not equal, you could use the following conditions:</p> <pre><code>(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.my-location &lt;my-loc&gt;)\n(&lt;my-loc&gt; ^north.content &lt;north&gt;\n^south.content &lt;&gt; &lt;north&gt;)\n</code></pre> <p>If you wanted to match the contents of both the north and south cells for use in the action, you could use the following conditions:</p> <pre><code>(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.my-location &lt;my-loc&gt;)\n(&lt;my-loc&gt; ^north.content &lt;north&gt;\n^south.content { &lt;south&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;north&gt; })\n</code></pre> <p>Remember, the not equal test, \u201c&lt;&gt;\u201d, must directly precede the symbol or variable it refers to. Soar also has tests for greater than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), and less than or equal to (&lt;=). These can be used when matching numbers and also precede the value they refer to. For example, to test that the eater\u2019s score is greater than 25, the following condition can be used. <code>(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.eater.score &gt; 25)</code></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/02/#move-operator-application","title":"Move Operator Application","text":"<p>This application rule for the move operator is a copy of the move-to-food operator application.

The preference language in Soar is rich enough to support a variety of ways of ordering the choices and we will explore different possibilities in this section.</p> <p>To get started, you need to create a rule to prefer bonusfood to normalfood or empty or an eater. The condition part of the rule must match against operator proposals, while the action part must prefer the operator that moves to the bonusfood. In English this would be:</p> <pre><code># Select*move*bonusfood-better-than-normalfood\n# If there is a proposed operator to move to a cell with bonusfood and\n# there is a second proposed operator to move to a cell that is empty or\n# has normalfood or another eater\n# prefer the first operator.\n``\n\nThe conditions of this operator must match against proposed operators\nbefore they have been selected. A proposed operator can be matched by\nmatching the acceptable preference for the operator, which is written in\nthe condition as the ^operator augmentation of the state, with a value\nfor the operator identifier, followed by a plus sign, \u201c+\u201d.\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n\nAcceptable preferences are the only preferences that are added to\nworking memory. All of the other preferences (better, best, worse,\nworst, and reject) are not added to working memory. They are held in\npreference memory and persist as long as the rule instantiations that\ncreated them still match. They are not in working memory because there\nis little advantage to having them available for other rules to match\nagainst, whereas the acceptable preferences must be in working memory\nbecause they define what operators are candidates for selection.\n\nAn operator can be preferred by creating a *better* than preference and\nthe decision procedure will use that preference in determining which\noperator to select \u2013 it will never select an operator if it is worse\nthan another candidate operator, unless that candidate is rejected. In\naddition to the better preference, there is a *worse* preference that is\nexactly the opposite. In an action, the better preference is the greater\nthan sign: \u201c&gt;\u201d. It is used in the same place as an acceptable or\nindifferent preference, except that a variable that matched the\nidentifier of the better operator is put before the greater than sign,\nand the variable that matched the identifier of the worse operator is\nput after the greater than sign. Therefore, the Soar rule is as follows:\n\n```Soar\nsp {select*move*bonusfood-better-than-normalfood-empty-eater\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o1&gt; +\n^operator &lt;o2&gt; +)\n(&lt;o1&gt; ^name move\n^content bonusfood)\n(&lt;o2&gt; ^name move\n^content &lt;&lt; normalfood empty eater &gt;&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o1&gt; &gt; &lt;o2&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>This rule will match two different proposed operators (operators with acceptable preferences), <code>&lt;o1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;o2&gt;</code>. Both have name move, while one matches operators that move to bonusfood while the other will match operators that move to normalfood, empty squares, or squares with another eater.</p> <p>If there are adjacent cells with both bonusfood and normalfood, this rule will fire right after propose*move creates acceptable preferences, but during the same proposal phase so that it will influence the next operator selection. It will fire multiple times if there are multiple cells with bonusfood or normalfood. After these preferences are created, the decision procedure will gather them up to make a decision.</p> <p>You can use exactly the same approach to prefer moving to cells with normalfood over moving to empty cells or cells with eaters. Soar provides an alternative with the worst preference, which means don\u2019t select the operator unless there are no other choices. In this case, you can create worse preferences for operators that move the eater into an empty cell or a cell with another eater. With these additional preferences, operators that move into cells with bonusfood or normalfood will always be selected if they exist, and otherwise the eater will randomly select between moving into an empty cell or into a cell with another eater. The new selection rule can be written in English as:</p> <pre><code># Select*move*avoid-empty-eater\n# If there is a proposed operator to move to an empty cell or a cell with\n# another eater,\n# then avoid that operator.\n</code></pre> <p>Here we use the word avoid to mean that the operator will only be selected if there is nothing worse. A worst preference is written as a less than sign: \u201c&lt;\u201d. This is similar to a worse preference, except that there is no second variable that the first variable is compared to.</p> <pre><code>sp {select*move*avoid-empty-eater\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n^content &lt;&lt; empty eater &gt;&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; &lt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>Just as there is a worst preference, there is also a best preference. The best preference means that an operator should be selected as long as there is no other operator better than it (or it is not worse than another operator is). Thus the meaning of best is a bit odd in that better preferences are more important than the best preferences and an operator with a best preference will not be selected if another operator is better than it.</p> <p>You could have used a best preference for a move into a cell with normalfood instead of using the worst preference. The move to normalfood would then be selected over a move to an empty cell or a cell with an eater. Select*move*bonusfood-better-than-normalfood-empty-eater will ensure that bonusfood is preferred to normalfood.</p> <pre><code># Select*move*prefer-normalfood\n# If there is a proposed operator to move to a cell with normalfood,\n# prefer that operator.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sp {select*move*prefer-normalfood\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n^content normalfood)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; &gt;)}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/02/#summary-of-preferences","title":"Summary of Preferences","text":"<p>This section summarizes the meaning of the preferences presented earlier.

The preferences can be thought of as a sequence of filters, processed in the following order.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Acceptable (+) An acceptable preference states that a value is a     candidatefor selection. Only values with an acceptable preference     have the potential of being selected. If there is only one value     with an acceptable preference, that value will be selected if it     does not also have a reject preference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reject (-) A reject preference states that the value is not a     candidatefor selection. A value will not be selected if it has a     reject preference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Better (&gt;), Worse (&lt;) These preferences state that a value     should not be selected if the better value is a candidate. If the     better value does not have an acceptable preference, or is rejected,     the better/worse preference is ignored. Otherwise, the worse value     is removed from consideration. Better and worse are simple inverses     of each other, so that A better than B is equivalent to B worse than     A.</p> </li> <li> <p>Best (&gt;) A best preference states that the value should be     selected if it is not rejected, or if there is no other value better     than it. If a value is best (and not rejected, or worse than     another),it will be selected over any other value that is not also     best. If two values are best, then the remaining preferences (worst,     indifferent) will be examined to determine the selection. If a value     (that is not rejected) is better than a best value, the better value     will be selected. (This result is counter-intuitive, but allows     explicit knowledge about the relative worth of two values to     dominate knowledge of only a single value.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Worst (&lt;) A worst preference states that the value should be     selected only if there are no alternatives. A worst will only be     considered if the above preferences have not filtered the choices to     a single choice. In this case, any value with a worst preference     will be discarded, unless all of the values have worst preferences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indifferent (=) An indifferent preference states that there is     positive knowledge that it does not matter which value is selected.     This may be a binary preference, to say that two values are mutually     indifferent, or a unary preference, to say that a single value is as     good or as bad a choice as other expected alternatives.

(You may think that you could write a single rule that both creates the last-direction and removes any old value for last-direction, but then a second rule would have to be written to cover the initial situation when there is no existing last-direction.)

If the structure can persist throughout the life of the eater, you can use a rule that tests that the state exists and then creates the structure in working memory in the action.

One requires modifying the proposal rule so that the operator is never proposed, and the second is to create a new selection rule that creates a preference that prevents the operator from being selected. We will look at both possibilities.</p> <p>In order to modify the proposal rule, recall the final move proposal:</p> <pre><code># Propose*move:\n# If the content of an adjacent cell is not a wall,\n# propose move in the direction of that cell, with the cell\u2019s content,\n# and indicate that this operator can be selected randomly.\n</code></pre> <p>A condition can easily be added that tests that the direction of the adjacent cell (<code>&lt;d&gt;</code>) is not equal to the opposite of the direction of the last move. However, this will not work for the first move when there is no direction for the last move because no operator has applied to create the memory of a previous move. An alternative is test that there does not exist an opposite of last direction that is equal to the direction of the adjacent cell. How is that different? The first tests that there does exist in working memory an augmentation of the state, but its value is not equal. The second tests that there does not exist in working memory an augmentation that is equal. The second one will be correct for the first move. Thus the revised English description is:</p> <pre><code># Propose*move*no-backward:\n# If there is normalfood, bonusfood, eater, or empty in an adjacent cell,\n# and there is no last direction equal to the opposite direction for that cell,\n# propose move in the direction of that cell, with the cell\u2019s content,\n# and indicate that this operator can be selected randomly.\n</code></pre> <p>To test for the absence of an augmentation, Soar uses a dash, \u201c-\u201c. The dash, called negation, precedes the augmentation that must not be in working memory for the rule to match. The new proposal rule is as follows:</p> <pre><code>sp {propose*move*no-backward\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^io.input-link.my-location.&lt;dir&gt;.content { &lt;co&gt; &lt;&gt;\nwall }\n^directions &lt;d&gt;\n\n-^last-direction &lt;o-dir&gt;)\n(&lt;d&gt; ^value &lt;dir&gt;\n^opposite &lt;o-dir&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move\n^direction &lt;dir&gt;\n^content &lt;co&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>A negation can also precede a complete object, where the identifier is followed by multiple attribute-values.

You can simplify the writing of future operators by writing two general rules that perform these functions for every operator that performs external actions.</p> <p>The first rule creates the action command on the output-link. To make this a completely general rule, you need to have a standard way of representing action commands on operators so that a single rule can create the commands on the output-link. The simplest convention is to have the action command be an augmentation of the operator, such as: <code>^jump.direction &lt;direction&gt;</code>. Another possibility would be to have a specific augmentation on the operator, say ^actions, that had the commands as subobjects:</p> <pre><code>(&lt;o&gt; ^actions.jump.direction &lt;direction1&gt;)\n</code></pre> <p>You probably want to adopt this second approach because it makes it possible to write a single rule that copies the action commands to the output-link without risk of copying other augmentations.

For example, if this rule is used in a Soar program, then the status complete augmentation will always be removed and will not be available for other rules to test. For this domain, it doesn\u2019t seem like that will be a problem, and it might not be for others as well. It is just that before creating a rule that applies to all operators, you should be careful.

The objects visible on the radar are those that are a distance of d squares or less away from the tank directly in front of it, directly in front of one square to the left of it, and directly in front of one square to the right of it. Radar also picks up any objects directly to the right or left of the tank. Additionally, if the effective distance is greater than d, i.e. the radar is being blocked by an object, then the object(s) d+1 squares directly in front of this tank is also visible on the radar.

This can be quite a disadvantage if a tank is under attack. To avoid penalizing tanks that are \u201cthinking\u201d a bit, TankSoar provides an alternative scheduler.

This will help you to get familiar with the TankSoar software. This tank will be the basis for a more complex tank you will build later.</p> <p>Wandering consists of moving around the map, using sensors to avoid bumping into obstacles and to detect other objects. A tank\u2019s main sensor for seeing other objects is its radar, which works from the front of the tank. Therefore, even though a tank can move in all four directions, it is best to move forward and turn to avoid obstacles. The radar uses up energy, so it is best to use it sparingly. The simplest thing to do is to turn on the radar when the tank turns, and turn it off if there is nothing interesting to see (such as tanks, missiles, the energy recharger, or the health recharger). One interesting issue is how much power should be used with the radar. To simplify things, you can always turn it on to 13, the maximum distance it can see. You will get a chance to improve your tank later, but for now it is best if it is simple.</p> <p>This analysis leads to the three operators and the search control described below:</p> <ul> <li>Move: move forward if not blocked.</li> <li>Turn: if front is blocked, rotate and turn on the radar with power 13.</li> <li>Radar-off: if the radar is on and there are no objects visible, turn     off the radar.</li> <li>If radar-off is proposed, then prefer it to move.</li> </ul> <p>This set of knowledge for wandering is just the start of a more complex tank, and you will have to add attacking other tanks, picking up missiles, and recharging later.</p> <p>The rest of this section goes through the creation of these operator and search control, step by step. If you feel confident that you can write these three operators and associated search control by yourself, go ahead and do it. All of the rules necessary to write the tanks in the tutorial are in the directory named Agents\\TankSoar\\Tutorial.</p> <p>Throughout the development of operators for TankSoar, you will use the general rules that were created in Eaters for copying actions from operators to the output-link. If you use these rules, many of the operators will have only proposals.</p> <p>To get started, create a new agent in Visual-Soar by loading in the default agent provided in the release and then saving it as a new project. The default agent includes the general output rules you created for the Eaters as well as a full data map for the TankSoar input-link and output-link. It also includes an initialization operator. This operator adds a name to the top state as the task name, which you should rename (probably along with the operator itself).

One part of those operators that was a bit tricky was the termination of the operator. In Eaters, we had to make sure that the proposal would retract after the operator applied. For Eaters that tested the cells surrounding them, no additional conditions were required because the contents of these cells changed on every move. The same holds true in TankSoar.

An alternative but related problem is that there are high-level activities that a tank can perform involving complex combinations of low-level actions. One such set of high-level activities consists of wandering, chasing, attacking, and retreating. Although these are high-level activities, a tank should be able to use its knowledge to select between these activities based on the current situation, just as it selects between different operators. Both of these problems are handled in Soar by allowing abstract high-level operators to be implemented in subgoals where a new state is created that allows low-level operators to be selected in pursuit of the high-level operators.</p> <p>The hierarchy of operators you will build looks like the following:</p> <p>In addition to this hierarchical structure, there will be additional rules for turning the shields on and off, and remembering sounds. These rules are independent of the hierarchy \u2013 they will be proposed and applied in any active goal.</p> <p>This section introduces subgoals by tracing through the proposal, selection, and application of the high-level operator for wander. In later sections, you will add other high-level operators for chase, attack, and retreat.</p> <p>Visual-Soar makes this easy to do. It allows you to create the abstract operators, such as wander and chase, and then create suboperators that are embedded within the abstract operators. See the documentation for Visual-Soar for details.</p> <p>The tank you will create will not be the best or smartest tank, but building it will teach you many new things about Soar.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/03/#wander-operator-proposal","title":"Wander Operator Proposal","text":"<p>If you think of wandering as an operator, then in Soar it consists of rules to propose it and then apply it.

However, wandering is not an activity that is easily represented by individual rules \u2013 it is better represented as the repeated selection and application of the operators you wrote in Section 2. How does Soar make it possible to use operators, such as move and turn, to apply a higher level operator such as wander? To find out, create a tank with only your wander operator proposal rule. Run it for two steps.</p> <p>What happens is that Soar detects that there are no rules that match and can fire when the wander operator is selected, which means that Soar cannot make progress. In Soar, this is called an operator no-change impasse, because an operator has been selected and there is no new decision to be made. There are three other types of impasses in Soar.</p> <ul> <li>A state no-change impasse is when no operators are proposed for the     current state.</li> <li>An operator tie impasse is when there are multiple operators     proposed, but insufficient preferences to select between them.</li> <li>An operator conflict impasse is when there are multiple operators     proposed, and the preferences conflict.</li> </ul> <p>Whenever an impasse arises, Soar automatically creates a new state (S3 in the trace above). The purpose of this state is to provide a context for selecting and applying operators to resolve the impasse (in the case, moving to a state where wander is no longer selected).</p> <p>Once a substate is created, operators can be selected and applied just as they are in the original state. These operators can change the local state, but they can also change the contents of original state (S1) by modifying the original state directly or by performing external actions that indirectly lead to changes in sensors, which in turn change the state. An impasse can also arise in the substate, which then leads to a stack of states. In the trace above, no operator is proposed in state S3, so another substate, S4, is created.</p> <p>To see all of the selected operators and their states, use the print-stack command. When a substate is created, it has some initial augmentations that distinguish it from other states. Take a look at the augmentations for state S3 above by printing S3.</p> <p>The most important of these is the superstate augmentation, which has as its value the identifier of the state in which the impasse arose (S2). You will use this augmentation to match the wander operator and other structures, such as the input-link and output-link.</p> <p>The processing in a substate can lead to the creation of structures that are part of the original state (the superstate). These are called results. In this example, the only results will be output commands for controlling the tank, but results can be any structure including operator acceptable preferences, other operator preferences, elaborations of the state, or changes to the state that are part of an operator application.</p> <p>All of the states in working memory are \u201cactive\u201d in that rules can fire for any level \u2013 it is not the case that processing in the top state comes to a halt while the processing goes on in the substate. In fact, it is the ability of the processing in the original state to start up that often resolves the impasse and leads to the termination of the subgoal. For example, in the substate for wander, we will add the operators for moving and turning. At some point, this may cause the tank to see and enemy tank, and fire a rule (in the top state) to propose the attack operator; while at the same time retract the rule that proposed the wander operator.</p> <p>Operator no-change impasses are resolved when the current operator is no longer preferred in the original state (S1 in the trace above). That can be because either the proposal for the current operator is retracted (the rule creating the proposal no longer matches), or because of the set of operator preferences changes so that another operator is preferred. State no-change impasses are resolved when an operator has been proposed (with an acceptable preference), so that there is at least one candidate operator. Tie and conflict impasses are resolved when sufficient preferences have been created so that the decision procedure can select an operator.</p> <p>When the impasse is resolved, the substate is automatically removed from working memory \u2013 it has served its purpose and is no longer needed. However, all of the results that were created in the subgoal can still persist. This is important because the results are changes to the superstate and are usually responsible for eliminating the impasse. Sometimes the results directly resolve the impasses, such as when a new preference is created that makes one of the tied operators best, but sometimes a result only indirectly resolves an impasse, such as a motor command to a tank that causes it to turn on its radar so it sees an enemy and decides to attack.</p> <p>Just as with all other working memory elements, the persistence of results must be determined by Soar. This is tricky because the rule for creating a result usually tests structures in a substate that will be removed once the impasse is resolved. If the result is an operator proposal, we don\u2019t want to remove the operator when the rule that created it no longer fires \u2013 that would defeat the purpose of the subgoal. Instead, Soar analyzes what structures had to exist in the superstate for that result to be produced by recursively backtracing through the conditions of the rule that created the result, finding the rules that fired in the subgoal that created the working memory elements that caused the rule to fire, until it finds all of the structures in the superstate that the result depended on. It collects these together and forms a justification that is essentially a fully instantiated rule. It then analyzes the rule to determine the persistence of the result (i-support or o-support). If it is i-support, then the justification is maintained until one of its conditions is no longer in working memory and then the result is retracted. If the justification gives o-support, then the result is maintained in working memory until it is explicitly deleted (or removed because it becomes disconnected from the state).</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/03/#wander-operator-suboperators","title":"Wander Operator Suboperators","text":"<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the wander operator is applied by selecting and applying operators in the substate.

A more general approach is to create rules that test for either the energy levels being low or no missiles, and create a structure in working memory that can be tested in the future.</p> <p>Rules for generating these classifications should be restricted to firing only in the top state.

I use 5 because it is long enough for the tank to turn around and get its radar on to hunt for the other tank.

This becomes a problem if the tank decides to turn and face in the direction of the sound (the tank will seem to chase its tail). A better approach is to record the absolute direction of the sound: north, east, south, or west. You can add an elaboration rule that computes the relative direction of the sound (forward, right, backward, left) in chase where it is needed.</p> <p>To compute the absolute direction requires creating a data structure in working memory that maps relative to absolute directions.

Since it is only needed in the implementation of chase, it only needs to be computed there. You may remember that all of the rules that propose operators to apply chase do not directly test the direction of the sound on the input-link. Instead, the input-link.sound was copied onto the chase state. Thus, to use the recorded sound, all you have to do is replace the elaboration rule in chase/elaborations.soar with one that computes the relative direction of the sound instead of copying the sound from the input-link. The direction-map structure can be used to do this calculation, which involves going from the current absolute direction of the tank, the absolute direction of the sound, to a relative direction of the sound.

However, testing the substate name indirectly influences the persistence of the result of the substate. This is a complex explanation that starts with the action of remove-sound, which is to create a reject preference for the sound data structure on the top-state. Although this action is part of the remove-sound operator, it is also a result of the substate/impasse created when a high-level operator was selected (wander, chase, retreat, or attack). When results are created, Soar computes their persistence (o-support or i-support) based on how they contribute to problem solving at the level to which they are returned. In Soar, this involves determining if the result is part of applying an operator at that level, which requires determining if an operator at that level was tested in generating the result.</p> <p>Soar determines which working memory elements were tested by recursively tracing back from the result, through all of the rules that fired in the subgoal and created structures that were tested in generating the results. The figure below shows a trace of the problem solving in the subgoal where elaboratestateoperator*name tests (S1 ^operator O7) and (O7 ^name chase) in creating (S8 ^name chase). Additional rules fire, testing the working memory elements, some of which exist in the superstate, and some which exist in the substate. Finally (S1 ^sound S5 -) is generated as a result. The trace starts with the result and proceeds backward, picking up all of the working memory elements from the superstate that were tested along the way. These are all underlined in the figure. If additional rules fired in the substate, but did not create results that contributed to the creation of (S1 ^sound S5 -), they would not be included in the trace.</p> <p>(S1 ^operator O7)</p> <p>(O7 ^name chase) (S8 ^name chase)</p> <p>From this trace, Soar generates a justification, which is essentially a rule that tests data structures that were in working memory before the impasse arose, and whose action is the result. The justification does not have any variables and includes tests for specific identifiers in working memory. (Soar\u2019s chunking mechanism replaces the identifiers in justifications with constants to build new rules.) In this case the justification would be:</p> <pre><code>(S1 ^operator O7)\n(O7 ^name chase)\n(S1 ^sound S5)\n(S5 ^expire-time 20)\n(S1 ^io I1)\n(I1 ^input-link I2)\n(I2 ^clock 21)\n--&gt;\n(S1 ^sound S5 -)\n</code></pre> <p>The justification is analyzed to determine if the result should get o-support or i-support. If the justification tests the operator, as it does in this case, then the result gets o-support. If the justification does not test the operator, the result gets i-support. If a result gets i-support, it is removed from working memory when any of the elements tested in the conditions of the justification are removed from working memory.</p> <p>Getting back to remove-sound, if the proposal for remove-sound does not test the name of the substate, the test for the operator in the superstate would not be included, making it independent of any operator application and the result would get i-support. However, if the proposal for remove-sound tests the name of the substate, the result is dependent on the selection of the operator, and the result will get o-support.</p> <p>This aspect of Soar is pretty complex and might have you wondering if you will be able to figure out how to create results with the right persistence. In general, you will find that all of the results you create in operator application substates should be o-supported, and they will as long as all of the rules that propose operators in the substate test the name of the substate. If you ever have an operator that should apply in a subgoal, but create an i-supported result, all you need to do is not test the name of the substate.</p> <p>Applying remove-sound is pretty straightforward.

Once init-map is selected, it creates the map structure:</p> <pre><code>sp {apply\\*init-map\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name init-map)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^map &lt;m&gt;)\n(&lt;m&gt; ^square &lt;s0-0&gt; &lt;s0-1&gt; &lt;s0-2&gt; \u2026)\n(&lt;s0-0&gt; ^x 0 ^y 0)\n(&lt;s0-1&gt; ^x 0 ^y 1)\n(&lt;s0-2&gt; ^x 0 ^y 2)\n\n\u2026}\n</code></pre> <p>Each square is initialized with its x and y location, which is the minimal information required to distinguish between the squares. Additional information and structure is required so that it is easy to access squares that are adjacent to the current square, and so it is easy to add information to the squares, such as that a square contains a recharger, tank, missile, or an obstacle, or that the square is clear. To make access of adjacent squares easier, we need to compute which squares are adjacent and then add augmentations between squares. The north and south adjacent squares have the same x value, but differ in y by one. Similarly the west and east adjacent squares have the same y value but differ in x by one. Thus, by adding one to the x value of every square we can find the square to the east, and by adding one to the y value, we can find the square to the south (we assume 0, 0 is in the upper left (north west) corner). We can then create east-west and north-south links between pairs of states. That is exactly what the following two rules do for east-west (there is a similar pair for north-south).</p> <pre><code>sp {top-ps*apply*init-map\\*add-adjacencies\\*east\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name init-map\n^map.square &lt;sq&gt;)\n(&lt;sq&gt; ^x { &lt; 15 &lt;x&gt; })\n--&gt;\n(&lt;sq&gt; ^east-x (+ &lt;x&gt; 1))}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sp {top-ps*apply*init-map\\*add-adjacent\\*link\\*east\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name init-map\n^map.square &lt;sq1&gt; &lt;sq2&gt;)\n(&lt;sq1&gt; ^y &lt;y&gt; ^east-x &lt;x&gt;)\n(&lt;sq2&gt; ^y &lt;y&gt; ^x &lt;x&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;sq1&gt; ^east &lt;sq2&gt;)\n(&lt;sq2&gt; ^west &lt;sq1&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>Another initialization that is done at this time is to mark all of the squares that are on the border as obstacles. This is done by matching all squares with x or y coordinates of 0 or 15 and then adding the obstacle *yes* augmentation to them. Below is an example for the x with value 15:</p> <pre><code>sp {map\\*mark-obstacle\\*x15\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name init-map\n^map.square &lt;sq&gt;)\n(&lt;sq&gt; ^x 15)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;sq&gt; ^obstacle \\*yes\\*)}\n</code></pre> <p>So during init-map, the map is created and then all of the squares are linked via north, south, east, and west attributes.

This is a bit tricky because the radar gives information relative to the agent and does not give the absolute x, y coordinates of objects that are seen. For example, if there is a tank detected on radar, its position will be given as a distance (in the direction the agent is facing), and either left, right, or center, meaning that it is either in line (center) or one space left or right of center. A rule must translate from that type of information into x, y. This can be done by creating a data structure in working memory that contains the right information for changes in x and y for each possible heading of the agent. In the mapping-bot, it is the radar-map data structure and it is created in elaborations/top-state as part of the elaborate*directions rule. Below is the structures that are created as part of radar-map:</p> <pre><code>--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^radar-map &lt;dirp&gt;)\n(&lt;dirp&gt; ^north &lt;northp&gt;\n^south &lt;southp&gt;\n^west &lt;westp&gt;\n^east &lt;eastp&gt;)\n(&lt;northp&gt; ^center &lt;cr&gt; ^right &lt;nr&gt; ^left &lt;nl&gt; ^sx 0 ^sy -1)\n(&lt;southp&gt; ^center &lt;cr&gt; ^right &lt;sr&gt; ^left &lt;sl&gt; ^sx 0 ^sy 1)\n(&lt;westp&gt; ^center &lt;cr&gt; ^right &lt;wr&gt; ^left &lt;wl&gt; ^sx -1 ^sy 0)\n(&lt;eastp&gt; ^center &lt;cr&gt; ^right &lt;er&gt; ^left &lt;el&gt; ^sx 1 ^sy 0)\n(&lt;cr&gt; ^x 0 ^y 0)\n(&lt;nr&gt; ^x 1 ^y 0)\n(&lt;nl&gt; ^x -1 ^y 0)\n(&lt;sr&gt; ^x -1 ^y 0)\n(&lt;sl&gt; ^x 1 ^y 0)\n(&lt;wr&gt; ^x 0 ^y -1)\n(&lt;wl&gt; ^x 0 ^y 1)\n(&lt;er&gt; ^x 0 ^y 1)\n(&lt;el&gt; ^x 0 ^y -1)}\n</code></pre> <p>For each direction, there is a substructure. For that substructure, there are center, left, and right objects, each of which contains displacements for x and y so that the coordinate can be computed correctly. In addition, get direction object contains an sx and sy augmentation that is used via multiplication to determine the displacement of the distance from the agent\u2019s current position. If the agent is facing north or south, sx is 0, so there is no x component to the distance, and the sy is either 1 or \u20131 depending on whether the agent is facing south or north.</p> <p>This structure is then used in rules that compute the x, y location of objects seen on radar.</p> <pre><code>sp {map\\*mark-object\n(state &lt;s&gt; ^name tanksoar\n^map &lt;m&gt;\n^io.input-link &lt;io&gt;\n^square &lt;cs&gt;\n^radar-map.&lt;dir&gt; &lt;dirr&gt;)\n(&lt;dirr&gt; ^&lt;pos&gt; &lt;pss&gt;\n^sx &lt;sx&gt;\n^sy &lt;sy&gt;)\n(&lt;pss&gt; ^x &lt;dx&gt;\n^y &lt;dy&gt;)\n(&lt;io&gt; ^radar.{ &lt;type&gt;\n\n&lt;&lt; health energy obstacle open missiles tank &gt;&gt; } &lt;ob&gt;\n^direction &lt;dir&gt;)\n(&lt;ob&gt; ^distance &lt;d&gt;\n^position &lt;pos&gt;)\n(&lt;cs&gt; ^x &lt;x&gt;\n^y &lt;y&gt;)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;m&gt; ^&lt;type&gt; &lt;obs&gt;)\n(&lt;obs&gt; ^x (+ (+ &lt;x&gt; (\\* &lt;sx&gt; &lt;d&gt;)) &lt;dx&gt;)\n^y (+ (+ &lt;y&gt; (\\* &lt;sy&gt; &lt;d&gt;)) &lt;dy&gt;))}\n</code></pre> <p>This creates a temporary (I-supported) structure on the map for each object seen on radar along with the x, y location.</p> <p>Following this, an additional rule can then match this structure with the squares in the map and update the map structure.

You could also include a test that an operator is selected <code>(^operator.name &lt;name&gt;)</code>, because this should be done no matter which operator is selected.

How do the missionaries and cannibals successfully cross the river?</p> <p>Once again, the first step to creating a Soar program to solve this problem is to decompose it into the problem space (state representation and operators) and the problem (initial state and desired state). One interesting aspect of this problem is that it also includes failure states. If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries, then you have failed.

Everything in the problem description is important (there are no irrelevant objects are characteristics of the objects), so an initial list of objects includes three missionaries, three cannibals, a river, and the boat.</p> <p>At any point in solving the problem, it is necessary to represent which bank of the river the boat is and the banks that the missionaries and cannibals are on. One important observation is that it is not necessary to keep track of each missionary and cannibal individually. All that is important is the number of missionaries and cannibals on each bank of the river. For the purposes of this problem all cannibals are the same and all missionaries are the same. Therefore, it is not necessary to have a separate representation of each missionary or cannibal and its current position. Another observation is that you never have to represent a state where the boat has missionaries and cannibals in it \u2013 that happens only during the application of an operator. The only states that need to be represented are those with the boat on one bank of the river or the other. Therefore the important aspects of the states that need to be represented are:</p> <ul> <li>The number of missionaries on each bank of the river.</li> <li>The number of cannibals on each bank of the river.</li> <li>The bank of the river that the boat is on.</li> </ul> <p>There are many possible ways to represent this information using Soar\u2019s attributes and values.

Using this representation, you would have to write separate proposal and application rules for when the boat is on each bank of the river. You would also have to write separate rules for moving cannibals and missionaries. When you have an attribute like right-bank-boat, the rules in Soar cannot match the different substructures, such as right-bank and boat.

One state representation has objects on the state for the two banks of the river, with subobjects for the missionaries, cannibals, and boat on that bank.

Below is a representation for the initial state:</p> <pre><code>(state &lt;s&gt; ^left-bank &lt;l&gt;\n  ^right-bank &lt;r&gt;)\n  ^cannibals 3\n  ^boat 1\n  ^other-bank &lt;r&gt;)\n  ^cannibals 0\n  ^boat 0\n  ^other-bank &lt;l&gt;)\n</code></pre> <p>An alternative is to make the missionaries, cannibals, and boat the primary way of structuring the data, with the number of entities on each bank of the river as secondary.</p> <pre><code>(state &lt;s&gt; ^missionaries &lt;m&gt;\n  ^cannibals &lt;c&gt;\n  ^boat &lt;b&gt;)\n(&lt;m&gt; ^left 3\n  ^right 0)\n  ^right 0)\n(&lt;b&gt; ^left 1\n  ^right 0)\n</code></pre> <p>For this problem, both of these representations are sufficient and they are similar in terms of the ease of writing the operators and goal tests.

For this task, the operator parameters that make sense are:</p> <ul> <li>The name of the operator: move-mac-boat.</li> <li>The type of entities being moved: cannibal or missionary.</li> <li>The number of each type of entity being moved: 1 or 2.</li> </ul> <p>The second two can be combined as a single attribute-value pair, with the type of entity being the attribute and the number being the value. This makes it easy to represent moving one or two entities of the same type as well as moving one missionary and one cannibal. To simplify later matching, you can also include the bank of the river that the boat is on. Also, for some of the reasoning, it will be useful to also represent how many different types of people are being moved, usually just one, but two when moving one missionaries and one cannibal. It is not necessary to include the bank of the river that the boat is on because it is represented in the current state.</p> <p>The operator representation for moving one cannibal (with the boat) from the bank with object l3 would be:</p> <pre><code>(&lt;o&gt; ^name move-mac-boat\n  ^cannibal 1\n  ^boat 1\n  ^bank l3\n  ^types 1)\n</code></pre> <p>Now try to write the first proposal as a Soar rule. To make it easier, a good approach is to initially write a very specific rule for one type of operator, and then attempt to generalize it by adding variables. To get started, you can try writing a proposal rule for just cannibals on the left bank of the river. That would be:</p> <pre><code>```Soar\nsp {mac*propose*move-mac-boat1\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name mac\n    ^left-bank &lt;bank&gt;)\n  (&lt;bank&gt; ^cannibals &gt; 0\n    ^boat 1)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n  (&lt;o&gt; ^name move-mac-boat\n    ^bank &lt;bank&gt;\n    ^boat 1\n    ^cannibals 1\n    ^types 1)}\n</code></pre> <p>The operator is created with both an acceptable and a indifferent preference. In a later section you will explore adding search control.</p> <p>You can generalize this rule by using a variable for the bank of the river, making it so that the proposal applies no matter which bank the boat is on. To be safe, this requires introducing a disjunctive <code>(&lt;&lt; left-bank right-bank &gt;&gt;)</code> test for the attribute.</p> <pre><code>```Soar\nsp {mac*propose*move-mac-boat*1\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name mac\n    ^&lt;&lt; right-bank left-bank &gt;&gt; &lt;bank&gt;)\n  (&lt;bank&gt; ^cannibals &gt; 0\n    ^boat 1)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n  (&lt;o&gt; ^name move-mac-boat\n    ^bank &lt;bank&gt;\n    ^boat 1\n    ^cannibals 1\n    ^types 1)}\n</code></pre> <p>You can then further generalize the rule so that it can match against both cannibals and missionaries (but not the boat). This requires introducing a disjunctive <code>(&lt;&lt; cannibals missionaries &gt;&gt;)</code> test for the attribute of the bank object, and also a surrounding conjunctive test <code>({ &lt;&lt; cannibals missionaries &gt;&gt; &lt;type&gt; })</code> to match the entity type to the variable <code>&lt;type&gt;</code>, which can then be used in the action. The final rule is:</p> <pre><code>```Soar\nsp {mac*propose*operator*move-mac-boat1\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name mac\n    ^&lt;&lt; right-bank left-bank &gt;&gt; &lt;bank&gt;)\n  (&lt;bank&gt; ^{ &lt;&lt; cannibals missionaries &gt;&gt; &lt;type&gt; } &gt; 0\n    ^boat 1)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move-mac-boat\n  ^bank &lt;bank&gt;\n  ^&lt;type&gt; 1\n  ^boat 1\n  ^types 1)}\n</code></pre> <p>Now try to write the second proposal that moves two missionaries or two cannibals as a Soar rule. This requires only minimal changes to the first. The only changes are to test for more than one missionary or cannibal, and to increase the number being moved to 2.</p> <pre><code>```Soar\nsp {mac*propose*operator*move-mac-boat2\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name mac\n    ^ &lt;&lt; right-bank left-bank &gt;&gt; &lt;bank&gt;)\n  (&lt;bank&gt; ^{ &lt;&lt; cannibals missionaries &gt;&gt; &lt;type&gt; } &gt; 1\n    ^boat 1)\n--&gt;\n(&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n(&lt;o&gt; ^name move-mac-boat\n^bank &lt;bank&gt;\n^&lt;type&gt; 2\n^boat 1\n^types 1)}\n</code></pre> <p>Now try to write the third proposal for moving one missionary and one cannibal.</p> <pre><code>sp {mac*propose*operator*move-mac-boat11\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name mac\n    ^ &lt;&lt; right-bank left-bank &gt;&gt; &lt;bank&gt;)\n  (&lt;bank&gt; ^missionaries &gt; 0\n    ^cannibals &gt; 0\n    ^boat 1)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)\n  (&lt;o&gt; ^name move-mac-boat\n    ^bank &lt;bank&gt;\n    ^missionaries 1\n    ^cannibals 1\n    ^boat 1\n    ^types 2)}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/04/#operator-application","title":"Operator Application","text":"<p>The operator application rules must change the state to reflect the movement of the boat and the missionaries and cannibals that cross the river. As part of applying the operators, it is not necessary to represent that the missionaries and cannibals are in the boat, only that they change banks of the river. The changes that need to be made to the state are to decrease the number of missionaries and cannibals that are moving from the bank of the river that the boat is on, and increase the number on the bank the boat is moving to. Similarly, the count of the boat (0 or 1) must be changed. You might try to come up with a set of rules to do this, but because of the operator representation, a single rule can make changes for moving cannibals, missionaries and the boat from either bank of the river to the other. The rule must test for an augmentation of the operator, such as <code>^boat</code>, <code>^cannibals</code>, or <code>^missionaries</code>, and then change the corresponding subobject on the state. The rule will fire in parallel for all entities being moved, including the boat.</p> <p>Below is an English version of the required rule.</p> <pre><code># mac*apply*move-mac-boat\n# If there is a move-mac-boat operator selected for a type and number, then\n# subtract the values of that type on the current bank and add those values\n# to the other bank.\n</code></pre> <p>Converting this to a Soar rule is a bit tricky because of all of the variables.

It then matches the number of cannibals on that bank, matching <code>&lt;bank-num&gt;</code>, via the other-bank attribute, matching <code>&lt;obank-num&gt;</code>. The actions of the rule modify the number of cannibals on the left bank by rejecting the current value <code>(^cannibals &lt;bank-num&gt; -)</code>, and by asserting the new value which is the original value minus one <code>(^cannibals (- &lt;bank-num&gt; 1))</code>. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication are done in Soar using prefix notation where the operation is given first followed by the operands.</p> <p>One concern you might have about the above rule is that it will apply multiple times if there is more than one cannibal on the left bank of the river, moving each cannibal, one by one to the other bank. However, that will not happen because immediately after this rule fires (multiple times in parallel for each entity being moved) the rule that proposed the operator will no longer match, causing the operator to be removed. The operator proposal rule will no longer match because it tested the number of cannibals on the left bank of the river, which is changed by the rule. In addition, the boat will move from one bank to another at the same time, providing a second reason for the proposal rule not to match. Thus, the operator will terminate immediately after the above rule fires.</p> <p>The next step is to generalize this rule so it can apply to moving 1 or 2 cannibals.

To avoid this, you can add two more rules that avoid undoing the last operator when the state is not a failure state.</p> <pre><code># mac*select*operator*avoid*inverse*not*failure\n# If the name of the state is mac and the current state is not a failure\n# state and the last operator is the inverse of a proposed operator, then\n# avoid that operator.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sp {mac*select*operator*avoid*inverse*not*failure*1\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name mac\n    ^operator &lt;o&gt; +\n    -^failure true\n    ^last-operator &lt;lo&gt;)\n  (&lt;o&gt; ^types 1\n    ^&lt;type&gt; &lt;number&gt;)\n  (&lt;lo&gt; ^types 1\n    ^type &lt;type&gt;\n    ^number &lt;number&gt;)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; &lt; )}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sp {mac*select*operator*avoid*inverse*not*failure*2\n  (state &lt;s&gt; ^name mac\n    ^operator &lt;o&gt; +\n    -^failure true\n    ^last-operator &lt;lo&gt;)\n  (&lt;o&gt; ^types 2)\n  (&lt;lo&gt; ^types 2)\n--&gt;\n  (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; &lt; )}\n</code></pre> <p>After you have added these final rules, your program should solve the problem much quicker. However, you will notice that there is still some inefficiency. For example, at the initial state, it is possible for the program to attempt to apply the same operator to the state after it has failed with moving one or both the other missionaries. The figure below shows the initial state and the three successive states that it can cycle among. The problem is that only the most recent operator for a current state is recorded. It is not possible to associate all prior operators that applied to a state because the state is continually changing.</p> <p>In the next Part of the tutorial, you will learn how to use impasses and substates so that your programs can use look-ahead planning and solve this type of problem more directly.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/05/","title":"Part V Planning and Learning","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/05/#under-construction","title":"\ud83d\udea7 Under Construction \ud83d\udea7","text":"<p>The HTML version of the tutorial is currently under construction; in particular, the figure annotations are missing.

The type of planning that you will learn about in this section is simple look-ahead planning. Other types of planning are possible in Soar, but this is the most natural. In fact, you will need to make only minor changes and a few additions to use planning in the Water Jug and Missionaries and Cannibals problems. This type of learning is called chunking, which is a form of explanation-based generalization. Within the examples in this section, chunking speeds up problem solving by creating search-control rules. In other types of problem solving, chunking creates other types of rules including elaborations, operator proposals and operator applications.</p> <p>In simple look-ahead planning, your program will try out operators internally to evaluate them before it commits to applying them in the actual task. In the programs that you developed in Part I and Part IV, all of the problem solving was internal, so it didn\u2019t really matter if a mistake was made. For example, in the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, you added rules to backup when a failure state was reached. However, in problems that involve interaction with a world where you can\u2019t always undo an action, it is often critical to try out actions internally before executing them in the world. In addition, planning provides a way of comparing alternative operators based on the states they produce. Chunking builds rules that summarize the comparisons and evaluations that occur in the look-ahead search so that in the future the rules fire, making look-ahead search unnecessary - converting deliberation into reaction.</p> <p>Many planning systems have a two-stage cycle of planning and execution. They always plan when given a new problem and then execute the plan step by step. Our approach in Soar is different. In Soar, each decision is made with whatever knowledge is available and planning is one more source of knowledge that can be used whenever the knowledge encoded directly as rules is insufficient to make a decision. Thus, planning is used on an as-needed basis. As we will see later, planning in Soar does not create a step-by-step sequence of operators to apply blindly, but instead learns a set of context-dependent rules that prefer or avoid specific operators for states in the space. As a result, Soar\u2019s plans are more flexible so that plans learned for one problem may transfer to part of a second problem. It also makes it so that Soar only plans when it needs to.</p> <p>Our study of planning will parallel the study of problem solving. You will first modify and extend the rules you wrote for the Water Jug problem and then the Missionaries and Cannibals problem.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/05/#the-water-jug-problem","title":"The Water Jug Problem","text":"<p>Planning in Soar arises out of its impasse detection and substate creation mechanism. Remember in TankSoar how subgoals were created when an operator was selected but there were no rules that could directly apply the operator. Soar has other impasses that arise when progress cannot be made for other reasons (see the manual for a complete description of impasses and substates). Soar automatically creates a subgoal whenever the preferences are insufficient for the decision procedure to select an operator. This is a signal that there is insufficient knowledge to make a decision and further problem solving is required. The decision procedure can choose an operator if there is either one clear winner (one operator that dominates the others based on the available preferences), or when there are multiple operators that are all indifferent. In the rules you\u2019ve written so far, there have always been indifferent preferences for every operator, so that the decision procedure always selected randomly among the preferred operators. However, indifferent preference should be used only when it is known that one operator is no better than another, instead of when it is not known which operator is best. Therefore, the first step to allow planning to be invoked is to eliminate the indifferent preference from the operator proposal rules.</p> <p>Below is the operator proposal for the fill operator in the Water Jug without the indifferent preference.</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*propose*fill\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n   (&lt;j&gt; ^empty &gt; 0)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; +)\n   (&lt;o&gt; ^name fill\n      ^jug &lt;j&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>Once that indifferent preference is removed, rerun your program and step through the first decision. You will discover that Soar automatically generates a new substate in situations where the operator preferences are insufficient to pick a single operator. This is called a _tie impasse.</p> <p>When a tie impasse arises, a new substate is created that is very similar to the substate created in response to an operator no-change. Print out the substate and examine the augmentations. The key differences are that an operator tie has <code>^choices multiple</code>, <code>^impasse tie</code>, and <code>^item</code> augmentations for each of the tied operators.</p> <p>For the operator no-change impasses you used in TankSoar, the goal was to apply the selected operator to its state. This was achieved by selecting and applying operators in the substate that modify the superstate either directly (by adding or removing augmentations) or indirectly (by performing actions in the world that led to changes in the sensors that are part of the state). For a tie impasse, the goal is determine which task operator is the best to apply to the current state. This will be achieved by selecting and applying evaluation operators in the substate, one for each of the task operators. The purpose of these operators is to create an evaluation of the task operators, such as failure, success or a numeric evaluation of the likelihood of success. These evaluations will then be converted in preferences for the task operators. Once sufficient preferences have been created to select a task operator, it will be selected and the substate will automatically be removed from working memory. It is possible that after evaluating only a subset of the tied task operators, sufficient evaluations will be created so that preferences are generated that break the tie. For example, if an operator is evaluated and it is determined that it leads directly to the goal, a best preference can be created. This might be sufficient to break the tie, select an operator, and resolve the impasse.</p> <p>One way in which task operators can be evaluated is by trying them out on internal copies of the states in which the tie occurred, and then evaluating the states they create. The evaluation of states can be based on whether they are at desired state, a failure state (as in Missionaries in Cannibals), or the initial state. Many problems also lend themselves to an evaluation function that can be applied to a state that estimates how close the state is to the goal. For example, in Chess, numbers are assigned to the different pieces and you compare the value of your pieces to your opponents.</p> <p>We will call the problem of resolving a tie impasse, the Selection problem throughout the rest of the tutorial. We will treat the development of rules and operators for the selection problem just as we would treat the development of a program to solve other problems, such as the Water Jug or Missionaries and Cannibals, and go through the same steps we went through for those problems. Although coming up with good state evaluation functions for a specific problem can be challenging, the overall approach is very general and requires only a few bits of domain-specific information. In fact, we have created a set of generic Soar operators/rules that carry out the evaluation and comparison of operators using this approach. This set of generic rules can be used in a wide variety of problems for simple planning and they are available as part of the Soar release. These rules are part of the default rules that come with the Soar release in the file <code>Agents/default/selection.soar</code>. You should load these rules when you load in the Water-jug rules. You can do this by adding the following commands to your files (assuming that your program is in a subdirectory of the Agents directory):</p> <pre><code>pushd ../default\nsource selection.soar\npopd\n</code></pre> <p>By going through the rest of this section you will learn how these rules work and what you need to provide for them to be used on other problems.</p> <p>From our previous work on solving problems in Soar, here are the types of knowledge we need to consider for the selection problem:</p> <ol> <li>The state representation. This includes the representation of     evaluation objects that link evaluations with operators.</li> <li>The initial state creation rule.

There are no special     monitoring rules for Selection.</li> <li>The desired state recognition rule. Desired state recognition is     automatic. When there are sufficient preferences, the decision     procedure selects an operator, the impasse is resolved, and the     substate is removed from working memory.</li> <li>The failure recognition rule.

However, the evaluations must also include the task operator that the evaluation refers to. Moreover, we will find it useful to have different types of evaluations that can be compared in different ways, such as symbolic evaluations (success, failure) or numeric evaluations (numbers over some ordered range). We will also find it useful to create the evaluation structure before the evaluation is known, so that it will be useful to have an augmentation of the evaluation object that signifies that a value has been created.

The desired structure is included so that the evaluation of an operator can be based on how well it helps achieve the desired state. This might be by achieving the desired state, or it might be based on a heuristic calculation of distance from the desired state to the state created by applying the operator being evaluated.</p> <p>The superproblem-space augmentation is the problem-space object of the superstate. What is a problem-space object? It is an explicit representation on the state of properties of the current problem space and can be used to cue the firing of rules relevant to the current problem space. The name augmentation of the state has served this purpose in the previous systems; however, it is insufficient in general because it contains only a single symbol, the name. By having an object, instead of just a name, additional properties of the problem space can be included. This is important in planning because the look-ahead search must use the same problem space and must copy the current state, which requires information about the structure of the problem space states..</p> <p>The second part is the calculation of the evaluation, which cannot be done directly with rules but requires its own substate. This substate is called to the evaluation problem. The original task state is copied to the evaluation substate. Then, the task operator being evaluated is applied to that state. If that new state can be evaluated, then the evaluation is returned as a result and added to the appropriate evaluation object. If no evaluation is possible, then problem solving in the task (such as the Water Jug) continues until an evaluation can be made. That may lead to more tie impasses, more substates, ...

Copying down all of the appropriate augmentations can be done by a few Water Jug specific rules; however, that means that with each new task, new state copy rules must also be written.

The desired state is also copied over, based on the copy commands for the state.</p> <p>These rules support two levels of copying. How should you decide what level of augmentations need to be copied? In the water jug, the state has two levels of structure: the jugs and their contents, volume, and empty:</p> <pre><code>(s1 ^jug j1 j2)\n(j1 ^volume 3\n   ^contents 0\n   ^empty 3)\n(j2 ^volume 5\n   ^contents 0\n   ^empty 5)\n</code></pre> <p>Is it sufficient to copy the augmentations of the state, or do the subobjects need to be copied as well? To answer this question, you need to look closely at how the operators modify the state. In the formulation of the problem we\u2019ve been using, the operators change the augmentations of the jugs. For example, the application rule for fill is:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*apply*fill\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;\n      ^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n   (&lt;o&gt; ^name fill\n      ^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n   (&lt;j&gt; ^volume &lt;volume&gt;\n      ^contents 0\n      ^empty &lt;volume&gt;)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;j&gt; ^contents &lt;volume&gt;\n         0 -\n      ^empty 0\n         &lt;volume&gt; - ) # (1)\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>To remove a working memory element, use <code>-</code>.</li> </ol> <p>This rule modifies the contents and empty augmentations. So if this is used to apply the fill operator to the three-gallon jug using the working memory elements above, <code>(j1 ^contents 0)</code> and <code>(j1 ^empty 3)</code> will be removed from working memory and <code>(j1 ^contents 3)</code> and <code>(j1 ^empty 0)</code> will be added to working memory. The result will be that not only is the \u201ccopy\u201d modified, but also the original state. Thus, this is unacceptable because it does not make it possible to apply operators to substate without modifying the original.</p> <p>There are two possible solutions. The first is to copy two levels of attributes. This can be achieved by adding the following to the actions of original state initialization rule for Water Jug:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*elaborate*problem-space\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^problem-space &lt;p&gt;)\n   (&lt;p&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^default-state-copy yes\n      ^two-level-attributes jug)}\n</code></pre> <p>You could use <code>^all-attributes-at-level two</code> instead, but it is best to list exactly the attributes you need to have copied. After using this, the substate, <code>s3</code>, would have the following structure:</p> <pre><code>(s3 ^jug j3 j4)\n(j3 ^volume 3\n  ^contents 0\n  ^empty 3)\n(j4 ^volume 5\n  ^contents 0\n  ^empty 5)\n</code></pre> <p>The second approach is to change the operator applications so that they do not modify the augmentations of the jug objects but instead create completely new jug objects. For example, a modified version of fill would be:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*apply*fill\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;\n      ^jug &lt;i&gt;)\n   (&lt;o&gt; ^name fill\n       ^jug &lt;i&gt;)\n   (&lt;i&gt; ^volume &lt;volume&gt;\n      ^contents 0\n      ^empty &lt;volume&gt;)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^jug &lt;i&gt; -\n      ^jug &lt;ni&gt;)\n   (&lt;ni&gt; ^volume &lt;volume&gt;\n      ^contents &lt;volume&gt;\n      ^empty 0)}\n</code></pre> <p>The disadvantage of this approach is that it requires more changes to working memory when an operator is applied, although it requires fewer working memory elements to be copied during the creation of the initial state. This approach also is less natural in that it implies that a new jug is created as opposed to just modifying the contents of the existing jug. For these two reasons, the first approach (<code>two-level-attribute</code> copying) is preferred.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/05/#selecting-the-operator-being-evaluated","title":"Selecting the operator being evaluated","text":"<p>Once the initial state of the evaluate-operator operator is created, a copy of the operator being evaluated needs to be selected.

This augmentation can be tested by rules to ensure that they are evaluating the result of applying the operator as opposed to the copy of the original state - although this will not work for operators that apply as a sequence of rules.</p> <p>The simplest evaluations to compute are success and failure. Success is when the goal is achieved. You have already written a rule that detects success for the Water Jug; however, this just halts the problem solving. This rule can be modified to create a working memory element that is used as an evaluation. The selection rules will automatically process an evaluation on a state in an evaluation state. The evaluation has two parts. The attribute is the type of evaluation and the value must be the identifier of the desired state. This ensures that the evaluation is done relative to the correct desired state. Therefore, the rule for detecting success should be modified to be as follows:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*evaluate*state*success\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^desired &lt;d&gt;\n      ^problem-space.name water-jug\n      ^jug &lt;j&gt;)\n   (&lt;d&gt; ^jug &lt;dj&gt;)\n   (&lt;dj&gt; ^volume &lt;v&gt; ^contents &lt;c&gt;)\n   (&lt;j&gt; ^volume &lt;v&gt; ^contents &lt;c&gt;)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^success &lt;d&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>In addition to success and failure, the selection rules can process other symbolic evaluations as well as numeric evaluations. The symbolic preferences that are processed are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>success: This state is the desired state. This is translated into a     best preference. It is also translated into a better preference if     another operator has a result state with an evaluation of     partial-success.</p> </li> <li> <p>partial-success: This state is on the path to success. This is     translated into a best preference.</p> </li> <li> <p>indifferent: This state is known to be neither success of failure.     This is translated into an indifference preference.</p> </li> <li> <p>failure: The desired state cannot be achieved from this state. This     is translated into a reject preference.</p> </li> <li> <p>partial-failure: All paths from this state lead to failure. This is     translated into a worst preference.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For numeric evaluations, an augmentation named <code>^numeric-value</code> should be created for the evaluation object for an operator. We will discuss numeric evaluations in more detail in a future section.</p> <p>If you include your original rules, the selection rules, and the two new rules described above (<code>water-jug*elaborate*problem-space</code>, <code>water-jug*evaluate*state*success</code>), your system will start doing a look-ahead search. You will notice that at each operator selection there is a tie and a recursive stack of substates is created. If the solution is ever found, it is only used locally to select the operator for the most recent tie impasse. As a result, it will have to rediscover the solution as it slowly \u201cbacks out\u201d of the substates. Another problem is that the system will often revisit the same state and generate an identical tie impasse deeper in the stack of states. The resolution of the first problem will wait until we introduce chunking.</p> <p>You can resolve the second problem by evaluating states that are already in the stack as failure. That means that if an operator is being evaluated, and if it produces a state that is the duplicate of a previous state (one already on the state stack), then it is considered a failure. Not only will this avoid long loops but it will also mean that the operator that undoes the most recent operator will be avoided. The good news is that by using this we can eliminate the rules for remembering the last operator.</p> <p>What does this rule need to have as its conditions? It needs to test the following:</p> <ol> <li>The desired state, which is used in the action: <code>(&lt;s1&gt; ^desired &lt;d&gt;)</code></li> <li>The contents of the state.</li> <li>That state exists after the operator has been applied in an     evaluation. Remember from earlier in this section that the correct     test for this is: <code>(&lt;s1&gt; ^tried-tied-operator)</code></li> <li>That there is a duplicate of that state that is earlier in the state     stack. There is nothing inherent in Soar that keeps track of all     earlier states - only the superstate is readily available. We need     to add rules that elaborate each state with all of its superstates     (and their superstates). We will call this the superstate-set.     Computing this requires only two rules - one that adds its     superstate to the superstate-set and one that adds all of the     superstate-set of the superstate to its superstate-set.</li> </ol> <pre><code>sp {Impasse__Operator_Tie*elaborate*superstate-set\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate &lt;ss&gt;)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^superstate-set &lt;ss&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sp {Impasse__Operator_Tie*elaborate*superstate-set2\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate.superstate-set &lt;ss&gt;)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^superstate-set &lt;ss&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>The rule to detect failure is then as follows:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*evaluate*state*failure*duplicate\n   (state &lt;s2&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^superstate-set &lt;s1&gt;\n      ^jug &lt;i1&gt;\n      ^jug &lt;i2&gt;\n      ^tried-tied-operator)\n   (&lt;i1&gt; ^volume 5 ^contents &lt;c1&gt;)\n   (&lt;i2&gt; ^volume 3 ^contents &lt;c2&gt;)\n   (&lt;s1&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^desired &lt;d&gt;\n      ^jug &lt;j1&gt;\n      ^jug &lt;j2&gt;)\n   (&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 5 ^contents &lt;c1&gt;)\n   (&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 3 ^contents &lt;c2&gt;)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s2&gt; ^failure &lt;d&gt;)}\n</code></pre> <p>With this rule added, the problem solving will be more directed, but it will take an excessive number of decisions to solve the problem. The problem is that as soon as a result is produced, such as that in a given state a specific operator leads to failure, it is forgotten so that the next time that state is encountered, the evaluation must be repeated. What is needed is some memory that relates a state and operator with a result, which is essentially a rule. Conceptually, the conditions that should be included in the rule are templates of the working memory elements that were tested in the processing that produced the result. This is exactly what chunking does.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/05/#chunking","title":"Chunking","text":"<p>Chunking is invoked when a result is produced in a substate. The result will be the action of a new rule. Chunking examines the working memory elements that were matched by the rule that created the result. If any of those working memory elements are linked to superstates, they become conditions in the new rule. For each of the remaining working memory elements, chunking finds the rule and associated working memory elements that were responsible for generating it and recursively backtraces until all of the conditions are collected. Some of the working memory elements tested in conditions require special processing. For example, if one of the tied operators is tested via an item augmentation of a state is tested in a rule that leads to the inclusion of a test for an acceptable preference for that operator in the superstate.</p> <p>This process requires that Soar maintain a copy of every instantiated rule firing in a substate. Once all of the conditions have been collected, Soar converts all identifiers that were in the working memory elements into variables and adds the rule to rule memory. The rule is immediately available for matching.</p> <p>Because chunking is based on the problem solving in a subgoal, the generality of any rule is determined by what was tested by the rules that participated in producing the result.

The reason for this is that with the current rules for operator implementation, chunking can learn some control rules that are overgeneral, rejecting an operator that is on the path to the goal. Specifically, chunking can learn a rule that states:</p> <p>If the current state has the boat on the right bank and two missionaries and two cannibals, reject an operator that moves one missionary and the boat to the left.</p> <p>This rule is learned when the operator to move one missionary to the left is evaluated in a evaluation subgoal and discovered to lead to a failure state - where there is one missionary and two cannibals on the right bank. The problem with this rule is that it doesn\u2019t include a test that no cannibals are also moved. If the operator moves a cannibal at the same time it moves a missionary, it does not produce a failure state. However, with the way the application rule is written, chunking is unable to pick up any test that no cannibals are being moved. A satisfactory fix to this problem is to add a test to the operator application rules for the number of types being modified by the operator (^types).</p> <pre><code>sp {mac*apply*move-mac-boat\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)\n   (&lt;o&gt; ^name move-mac-boat\n      ^{ &lt;&lt; missionaries cannibals boat &gt;&gt; &lt;type&gt; } &lt;num&gt;\n      ^bank &lt;bank&gt;\n      ^types &lt;types&gt;)\n   (&lt;bank&gt; ^&lt;type&gt; &lt;bank-num&gt;\n      ^other-bank &lt;obank&gt;)\n   (&lt;obank&gt; ^&lt;type&gt; &lt;obank-num&gt;)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;bank&gt; ^&lt;type&gt; &lt;bank-num&gt; -\n      (- &lt;bank-num&gt; &lt;num&gt;))\n   (&lt;obank&gt; ^&lt;type&gt; &lt;obank-num&gt; -\n      (+ &lt;obank-num&gt; &lt;num&gt;))}\n</code></pre> <p>Once this is included, the learned chunked changes to be:</p> <p>If the current state has the boat on the right bank and two missionaries and two cannibals, reject an operator that moves only one missionary and the boat to the left.</p> <p>Now the system should successfully solve the problem, and after chunking, solving it in the minimal number of steps.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/05/#numeric-evaluations","title":"Numeric Evaluations","text":"<p>Without chunking, Soar takes a very long time to solve the problem because it does not get any evaluation until the problem is solved, and then must resolve the problem many times. One approach to avoid the long search is to add in some evaluations of the states that don\u2019t require the final state to be achieved. All that is needed is a good evaluation function. A very simple evaluation function is to prefer states that have more missionaries and cannibals on the desired bank of the river. Thus, the evaluation is just the sum of the number of missionaries and cannibals on the desired bank of the river, with higher numbers preferred.</p> <p>There are selection rules that do all of the domain-independent processing, such as comparing evaluations and creating the appropriate preferences. All you need to do is add a rule to compute the evaluation, and augment the desired state such that higher numbers are better. For example, the second of these changes leads to the following initialization rule:</p> <pre><code>sp {mac*apply*initialize-mac\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator.name initialize-mac)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^right-bank &lt;r&gt;\n      ^left-bank &lt;l&gt;\n      ^desired &lt;d&gt;)\n   (&lt;r&gt; ^missionaries 0\n      ^cannibals 0\n      ^boat 0\n      ^other-bank &lt;l&gt;)\n   (&lt;l&gt; ^missionaries 3\n      ^cannibals 3\n      ^boat 1\n      ^other-bank &lt;r&gt;)\n   (&lt;d&gt; ^right-bank &lt;dl&gt;\n      ^better higher) # (1)\n   (&lt;dl&gt; ^missionaries 3\n      ^cannibals 3\n      ^boat 1)}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>New augmentation</li> </ol> <p>The rule that computes the evaluation must test the desired state to determine which bank is the desired one. It must also match the number of missionaries and cannibals on that bank, as well as test that the operator being evaluated has applied (<code>^tried-tied-operator</code>).

Without chunking, the solution is found much faster with this rule. However, once chunking is used, an interesting thing happens. This rule actually hurts performance. The reason is that the evaluation is only a heuristic and is sometimes wrong. Chunking captures both the good and the bad aspects of the evaluation and uses them for selecting the operators. When this evaluation is not used, all of the learning is based on absolute features of the task: success and failure. There are no heuristics that are sometimes wrong, so the rules are always correct.

Thus we will modify the empty, fill, and pour operators to afford them RL updatable rules.</p> <p>Modifying the Water-Jug agent\u2019s rules to make them compatible with RL will take two steps: (a) modify the existing proposal rules and (b) creating new RL rules.

Next, we will write RL rules whose conditions detect these acceptable preferences and compliment with numeric indifferent preferences.</p> <p>The second step of agent modification can be much more laborious. In order for RL to provide feedback for each action in each state of the problem, it must have an RL rule for each state-action pair. In the Water Jug problem, a state can be represented by the volume of each of the jugs and the action (empty, fill, or pour) with one of the two jugs. As an example, one RL rule for the emptying the 3-unit jug (currently storing 2 units) when the 5-unit jug has 4 units could be written as follows:</p> <pre><code>sp {water-jug*empty*3*2*4\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^operator &lt;op&gt; +\n      ^jug &lt;j1&gt; &lt;j2&gt;)\n   (&lt;op&gt; ^name empty\n      ^empty-jug.volume 3)\n   (&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 3\n      ^contents 2)\n   (&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 5\n      ^contents 4)\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;op&gt; = 0)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For simple agents, like the Left-Right agent above, enumerating all state-action pair as RL rules by hand is plausible. However, the Water-Jug agent requires \\((3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6) = 144\\) RL rules to fully represent this space. Since we can express these rules as the output of a simple combinatorial pattern, we will use the Soar <code>gp</code> command to generate all the rules we need:</p> <pre><code>gp {rl*water-jug*empty\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^operator &lt;op&gt; +\n      ^jug &lt;j1&gt; &lt;j2&gt;)\n   (&lt;op&gt; ^name empty\n      ^empty-jug.volume [3 5])\n   (&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 3\n      ^contents [0 1 2 3])\n   (&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 5\n      ^contents [0 1 2 3 4 5])\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;op&gt; = 0)\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>gp {rl*water-jug*fill\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^operator &lt;op&gt; +\n      ^jug &lt;j1&gt; &lt;j2&gt;)\n   (&lt;op&gt; ^name fill\n      ^fill-jug.volume [3 5])\n   (&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 3\n      ^contents [0 1 2 3])\n   (&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 5\n      ^contents [0 1 2 3 4 5])\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;op&gt; = 0)\n   }\n</code></pre> <pre><code>gp {rl*water-jug*pour\n   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name water-jug\n      ^operator &lt;op&gt; +\n      ^jug &lt;j1&gt; &lt;j2&gt;)\n   (&lt;op&gt; ^name pour\n      ^empty-jug.volume [3 5])\n   (&lt;j1&gt; ^volume 3\n      ^contents [0 1 2 3])\n   (&lt;j2&gt; ^volume 5\n      ^contents [0 1 2 3 4 5])\n   --&gt;\n   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;op&gt; = 0)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that had the rules required a more complex pattern for generation, or had we not known all required rules at agent design time, we would have made use of rule templates.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/06/#reward-rules","title":"Reward Rules","text":"<p>Reward rules are just like any other Soar rule, except that they modify the reward-link structure of the state to reflect reward associated with the agent\u2019s current operator decision.

It is the agent\u2019s responsibility to maintain the reward-link structure to reflect proper feedback to the RL mechanism. In most cases, this means reward rules will be i-supported, such as to create non-persistent reward values. If an attribute remains on the reward-link structure, such as through an o-supported rule, the reward will count multiple times in the reinforcement learning.</p> <p>For the Water-Jug agent, we will provide reward only when the agent has achieved the goal.

For information on the other policies you should read the Soar manual. Epsilon greedy is a policy common within reinforcement learning experimentation to allow parameter-controlled exploration of operators not currently recognized as most preferred. This policy is controlled by the epsilon parameter. The policy is summarized as such:</p> <pre><code>With ( 1 - epsilon ) probability, the most preferred operator is to be\nchosen. With epsilon probability, a random selection of all indifferent\noperators is made.\n</code></pre> <p>When Soar is first started, the default exploration policy is softmax. However, the first time RL is enabled, the architecture automatically changes the exploration policy to epsilon-greedy, a policy more suitable for RL agents. The default value of epsilon is 0.1, dictating that 90% of the time the operator with greatest numerical preference value is chosen, while the remaining 10% of the time a random selection is made from all acceptable proposed operators. You can change the epsilon value by issuing the following command:</p> <pre><code>indifferent-selection --epsilon &lt;value&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Acceptable values for epsilon are numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive). You may note, by the definition, that a value of 0 will eliminate the chance of exploration and a value of 1 will result in a uniformly random selection.</p> <p>With this explanation, you should experiment with different values of epsilon during different runs in the agents discussed in this tutorial.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/07/","title":"Part VII Semantic Memory","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/soar_tutorial/07/#under-construction","title":"\ud83d\udea7 Under Construction \ud83d\udea7","text":"<p>The HTML version of the tutorial is currently under construction; in particular, the figure annotations are missing.

To enable storage, episodic memory must be enabled. By default, all learning mechanisms in Soar are disabled. To enable episodic memory, issue the following command:</p> <pre><code>epmem --set learning on\n</code></pre> <p>There are a few architectural parameters that are important to control episodic storage. The first is the event that triggers storage. By default, episodic memory stores new episodes whenever a WME is added to working memory that has the output-link as its identifier. However, Soar also supports storing episodes each decision cycle (\"dc\"), which is enabled using the following command (which we used in Part 1 of this tutorial):</p> <pre><code>epmem --set trigger dc\n</code></pre> <p>The next important parameter is the phase during which episodic memory stores episodes (and processes retrievals, as discussed later).

Episodic memory supports specifying a set of excluded attributes: if automatic storage encounters an excluded attribute during a breadth-first walk of working memory, it does not store that WME, nor any substructure if it was the case that the value of the WME was an identifier.

The syntax of the command is (<code>&lt;cmd&gt; ^query &lt;cue&gt;</code>), where <code>&lt;cue&gt;</code> forms the root of the cue. Conceptually, episodic memory compares the cue to all episodes in the store, scoring each one, and returns the most recent episode with the maximal score.</p> <p>Episodes are scored based upon the leaf WMEs in the cue. A leaf WME has either a value that is a constant, a long-term identifier, or a short-term identifier with no augmentations. A leaf WME is satisfied, with respect to a particular episode, if there exists a path, or sequence of WMEs, from the episode root to that leaf WME, where the attributes of all intermediate WMEs exactly match those in the cue, and short-term identifiers in the cue variablize to consistently match identifiers in the episode. This is similar to how variables in the conditions of rules bind to specific identifiers in working memory. However, as discussed below, episode scoring is disjunctive with respect to leaf WMEs (i.e. each leaf WME is considered independently), whereas rule matching is conjunctive with respect to production conditions (i.e. a rule matches only if all conditions are satisfied). By default, the score of an episode is simply the number of satisfied leaf WMEs.</p> <p>Let us consider an example cue, composed of the following WMEs, where N1 is the value of the query command, as described above:</p> <pre><code>(N1 ^feature value\n   ^id N2)\n(N2 ^sub-feature value2\n   ^sub-id N3)\n</code></pre> <p>Or, visually:</p> Example cue <p>This cue has three leaf WMEs: (<code>N1 ^feature value</code>), (<code>N2 ^sub-feature value2</code>), and (<code>N2 ^id N3</code>). Now consider the following episode:</p> Episode to match cue <p>The first leaf WME of the cue, (<code>N1 ^feature value</code>), is not satisfied by this episode, as there is no (<code>E1 ^feature value</code>) WME: (<code>E1 ^feature2 value</code>) has a different attribute and (<code>E1 ^feature value3</code>) has a different value. Both other leaf WMEs, however, are satisfied. (<code>N2 ^sub-feature value2</code>) is satisfied by variablizing E1 as N1 and E2 as N2: (<code>E1 ^id E2</code>) and (<code>E2 ^sub-feature value2</code>). (<code>N2 ^id N3</code>) is satisfied by variablizing <code>E1</code> as <code>N1</code>, <code>E3</code> as <code>N2</code>, and <code>E5</code> as <code>N3</code>: (<code>E1 ^id E3</code>), (<code>E3 ^sub-id E5</code>). Note that the substructure of E4 in the episode matches that of N2 in the cue, but there is no WME (<code>E1 ^id E4</code>), and so <code>E4</code> is not considered. Thus, this episode, with respect to the cue, has a score of 2.</p> <p>Note, however, that it is not possible to unify the cue with the episode: there is no single identifier in the episode that, when bound as <code>N2</code> in the cue, satisfies both (<code>N2 ^sub-feature value2</code>) and (<code>N2 ^sub-id N3</code>). If an episode gets a perfect score, such that all leaf WMEs are satisfied, episodic memory attempts to graph match the cue with the episode (i.e. determine if there exists an isomorphism between the cue and the episode). So in response to a cue-based retrieval command, episodic memory will return the most recent graph-matched episode, or, if one does not exist, the most recent episode with the maximal episode score.
