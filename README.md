# Soar Website

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️⚠️⚠️

This repository contains the source for the (new as of 2024) homepage for the
Soar cognitive architecture, including source for the PDF's distributed with Soar.

The website is not yet fully migrated from the old site, and is still under construction.

The site is built using the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site
generator that uses Markdown files to generate a website. The theme is
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Large files that are not displayed but rather downloaded not be stored here;
instead, put them in the [website downloads repository](https://github.com/SoarGroup/website-downloads).

## Setup/Running

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve # add -s to abort on any warnings
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages automatically as long as the build workflows
don't fail.

## Updates for New Soar Versions

*   Update the `soar_version` variable in `mkdocs.yml`.
*   Add announcement with link to `docs/index.md`.
*   Run the link-checker (manually triggered GH action workflow) to ensure all
    new release artifact links are valid.
