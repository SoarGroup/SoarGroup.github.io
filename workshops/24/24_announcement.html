               <P>The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Michigan and Soar 
                  Technology, Inc. are pleased to announce that the 24th Soar Workshop will be 
                  held Monday, June 7 through Friday, June 11, 2004, in Ann Arbor, MI. Soar 
                  Tutorials will be offered on June 7 and 8, in conjunction with the Workshop.
               </P>
               <P>All workshop, hotel, tutorial and additional information will be available on 
                  this web page. Periodic updates may be announced to soar-group, but please 
                  check this web page for the most up-to-date information.

      <P>Each year members of the Soar community--faculty, scientists, graduate 
         students, technical staff and developers--gather together for several days of 
         intensive interaction and exchange on Soar. The Soar community is widely 
         distributed geographically. These workshops provide the opportunity for having 
         face-to-face conversations, for hearing about the current status of other 
         participants’ research, and for looking forward to what will be happening in 
         the future. We will try to give as many members of the community as possible 
         the opportunity to describe their research or to discuss whatever Soar issues 
         are of concern to them. This means the time available per talk is quite short 
         (typically either 5 or 15 minutes). Since workshop attendees are already 
         well-entrenched in the Soar world, however, brief talks that concentrate on 
         only the essentials work very well.
      </P>
      <P>The Soar Workshop is announced on the soar-group mailing list, but we do want 
         to ensure that everyone actively working with Soar does get invited. If you 
         know of anyone who really should have been invited, but did not receive an 
         announcement, please let us know. Proceedings from the previous Soar workshops 
         are available online:</P>

         preferred.

         on the evening of the 8th (Tuesday) printed&nbsp;single sided with multiple 
         slides&nbsp;per page (2, 4 or 6 depending on readability) to conserve space in

      <P>Hawthorn and Microtel offer a complimentary breakfast, and are adjacent to the 
         building where the Workshop will be held. It is up to attendees to book their 
         own reservations. A map showing three of the&nbsp;hotels is on the first page 
         of <A href="http://www.soartech.com/soar22maps.pdf">this document</A>. For the 
         Hawthorn and Holiday Inn make sure to specify the “Soar Rate” when making your

      <P>The hotels listed above are approximately 4 miles from the central campus, and 
         1-2 miles from the north campus, of the University of Michigan. There are many 
         other hotels in the Ann Arbor area, but just a few are within walking distance 
         of the main campus and none are nearer the north campus than the five listed 
         above.</P>
