This release of Soar contains ergonomic improvements to the debugger and Soar CLI,
lots of new VisualSoar features, and plenty of bug fixes and stability
improvements. Note: if you are a Mac user with an Intel processor and you
downloaded the release prior to August 19, 2024, then you will need to
re-download. There was an issue with the setup script for Mac/Intel users which
would prevent running Soar.
