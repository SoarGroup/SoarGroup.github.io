# Soar Homepage

Soar is a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit
intelligent behavior. For more in-depth information, see our [about](home/About.md)
page, or J.E. Laird's 2012 book,
[*The Soar Cognitive Architecture*](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/sitemaker/misc/7688_jkt_au.pdf),
available from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Soar-Cognitive-Architecture-John-Laird/dp/0262122960/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332172759&sr=8-1-spell)

Congratulations to Professor John Laird and Professor Paul Rosenbloom for being
awarded the 2018 Herbert A. Simon Prize for Advances in Cognitive Systems! This
lifetime achievement award recognizes their 30 years of research on cognitive
architectures, especially their Soar project, their applications to knowledge-based
systems and models of human cognition, and their contributions to theories of
representation, reasoning, problem solving, and learning.
