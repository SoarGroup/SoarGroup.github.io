# Downloads: Domains

This category contains an extensive list of domains you can develop agents in.
Some are game-like environment simulators while other provide access to an
external knowledge source for your agent to process and manipulate, for example
WordNet or SoarQnA. All of these domains are fully interfaced with Soar already.
