# Java Logger

**This project contains an example of a Java program that interfaces with Soar.**

This application shows an example of how to build a simple logging tool. To use
it you would run a Soar kernel somewhere (in an environment or inside the debugger
for example) and then run this logger. The logger listens for certain events and
then creates a log file.

The idea is that you could take this simple app and modify it to log what you need
for your specific application, outputing the data in whatever format you want.
