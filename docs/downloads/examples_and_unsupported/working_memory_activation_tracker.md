# Working Memory Activation Tracker

This is a simple pair of scripts to help debug/visualize working-memory activation
values. The first script (`gen_wma.cpp`) runs a Soar agent for a fixed number of
decisions, outputting working memory at each decision to a specially named file.
The second script (`aggregate_wma.php`) takes these files and produces a CSV file
where every working-memory element (columns) has an activation value for every
decision (rows). This allows for easy graphing of activation in Excel, for instance.

## Documentation

### Usage: Prerequisites

The first script is written in C++ (for speed reasons), whereas the second is in
PHP. Thus, you will a Soar distribution to link the C++ program and the PHP CLI
on the system to run.

### Usage: Building

Included is a build script (build.sh) that works on Mac, assuming the `SOAR_HOME`
environmental variable has been defined. This should also work on Linux. It has
not been tested on Windows.

### Usage: Running

The data producer (gen_wma.cpp) has hard-coded the agent file it's going to use
(`agent.soar`). I've provided one such agent as an example, which simply counts
and, using mods, has rules match WMEs on fixed patterns. It will output `wma#.txt`
for each decision, where `#` refers to that decision number. The number of decisions
to run is provided as a command-line parameter.

The data consumer (`aggregate_wma.php`) also takes as a command-line parameter the
number of decisions, looks for the corresponding set of `wma#.txt` files (for
i=1..`#`). It outputs wma.csv after the analysis (beware of clobbering data!).

I've provided a run script (`run.sh`) that takes as a command-line parameter the
number of decisions to run. It calls the producer, then consumer, then cleans up
the text files. It's a bash script, and so should run fine on Mac/Linux.
