# Tower of Hanoi SML Example

This project contains an example of a C++ based environment that interfaces with
Soar. It implements a graphical version of the Towers of Hanoi. There is no option
to load custom agents or interface to observe the agent trace. This project is an
SML example, not a Towers of Hanoi test domain.

The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks
of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks
in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top,
thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack
to another rod, obeying the following rules:
Only one disk may be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto
another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
