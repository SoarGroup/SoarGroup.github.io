# Tcl Command Line Filter Example

FilterTcl demonstrates how to write a client that intercepts commands to allow one
to use Tcl from the command line (like earlier versions of Soar).

To demonstrate its capabilities, it comes packaged with both TclEaters and the TSI
(Tcl Soar Interface, i.e. the old Tcl-based Soar debugger.)

**Note:** Soar now includes embedded Tcl support via TclSoarLib, which may provide
a more recent example of Tcl interfacing.
