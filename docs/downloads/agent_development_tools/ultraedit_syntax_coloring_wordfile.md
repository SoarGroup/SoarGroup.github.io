# UltraEdit Syntax Coloring Wordfile

This file allows you to edit Soar files in the cross-platform editor UltraEdit
more easily. This file provides the following functionality:

*   Automatic indentation
*   Syntax coloring
*   Mass commenting (select a block of text and un/comment them all in one step)
*   Function lists (a list of all productions in a file will appear in the function
list. Click on a function to immediately scroll to it.)
*   Code folding (click on the plus sign next to a production and it will hide all
of its contents except the first line)
