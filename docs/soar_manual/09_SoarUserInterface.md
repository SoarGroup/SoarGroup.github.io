# The Soar User Interface

This chapter describes the set of user interface commands for Soar. All
commands and examples are presented as if they are being entered at the
Soar command prompt.

This chapter is organized into 7 sections:

1. Basic Commands for Running Soar
1. Examining Memory
1. Configuring Trace Information and Debugging
1. Configuring Soar’s Run-Time Parameters
1. File System I/O Commands
1. Soar I/O commands
1. Miscellaneous Commands

Each section begins with a summary description of the commands covered
in that section, including the role of the command and its importance to
the user. Command syntax and usage are then described fully, in
alphabetical order.

The following pages were automatically generated from the git repository
at

<https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/wiki>

on the date listed on the title page of this manual. Please consult the
repository directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

For a concise overview of the Soar interface functions, see the Function
Summary and Index on page . This index is intended to be a quick
reference into the commands described in this chapter.

## Notation

The notation used to denote the syntax for each user-interface command
follows some general conventions:

- The command name itself is given in a **bold** font.
- Optional command arguments are enclosed within square brackets, `[` and `]`
- A vertical bar, `|`, separates alternatives.
- Curly braces, `{}` , are used to group arguments when at least one
  argument from the set is required.
- The commandline prompt that is printed by Soar, is normally the
  agent name, followed by ’’. In the examples in this manual, we use
  "".
- Comments in the examples are preceded by a ’#’, and in-line comments
  are preceded by ’;#’.

For many commands, there is some flexibility in the order in which the
arguments may be given. (See the online help for each command for more
information.) We have not incorporated this flexible ordering into the
syntax specified for each command because doing so complicates the
specification of the command. When the order of arguments will affect
the output produced by a command, the reader will be alerted.

Note that the command list was revamped and simplified in Soar 9.6.0.
While we encourage people to learn the new syntax, aliases and some
special mechanism have been added to maintain backwards compatibility
with old Soar commands. As a result, many of the sub-commands of the
newer commands may use different styles of arguments.

## Basic Commands for Running Soar

This section describes the commands used to start, run and stop a Soar
program; to invoke on-line help information; and to create and delete
Soar productions. It also describes how to configure some general
settings for Soar.

The specific commands described in this section are:

- [soar](../reference/cli/cmd_soar.md#soar)  
  Commands and settings related to running Soar. Use **soar ?**
  for a summary of sub-commands listed below.
  
    - soar init  
      Reinitialize Soar so a program can be rerun from scratch.
  
    - soar stop  
      Interrupt a running Soar program.
  
    - soar max-chunks  
      Limit the number of chunks created during a decision cycle.
  
    - soar max-dc-time  
      Set a wall-clock time limit such that the agent will be
      interrupted when a single decision cycle exceeds this limit.
  
    - soar max-elaborations  
      Limit the maximum number of elaboration cycles in a given
      phase.
  
    - soar max-goal-depth  
      Limit the sub-state stack depth.

      decision.
  
    - soar tcl  
      Controls whether Soar Tcl mode is enabled.
  
    - soar timers  
      Toggle on or off the internal timers used to profile Soar.
  
    - soar version  
      Returns version number of Soar kernel.
  
    - soar waitsnc  
      Generate a wait state rather than a state-no-change
      impasse.

- [run](../reference/cli/cmd_run.md#run)  
  Begin Soar’s execution cycle.

- exit  
  Shut down the Soar environment. Terminates Soar and exits the kernel. `stop exit`

- [help](../reference/cli/cmd_help.md#help)  
  Provide formatted, on-line information about Soar commands.

- [decide](../reference/cli/cmd_decide.md#decide)
  Commands and settings related to the selection of operators
  during the Soar decision process
  
    - decide indifferent-selection  
      Controls indifferent preference arbitration.
  
    - decide numeric-indifferent-mode  
      Select method for combining numeric preferences.
  
    - decide predict  
      Predict the next selected operator
  
    - decide select  
      Force the next selected operator
  
    - decide set-random-seed  
      Seed the random number generator.

- [alias](../reference/cli/cmd_alias.md#alias)  
  Define a new alias, or command, using existing commands and
  arguments.

These commands are all frequently used anytime Soar is run.

## Procedural Memory Commands

This section describes the commands used to create and delete Soar
productions, to see what productions will match and fire in the next
Propose or Apply phase, to watch when specific productions fire and
retract, and to configure options for selecting between mutually
indifferent operators, along with various other methods for examining
the contents and statistics of procedural memory.

The specific commands described in this section are:

- [sp](../reference/cli/cmd_sp.md#sp)  
  Create a production and add it to production memory.

- [gp](../reference/cli/cmd_gp.md#gp)  
  Define a pattern used to generate and source a set of Soar
  productions.

- [production](../reference/cli/cmd_production.md#production)  
  Commands to manipulate Soar rules and analyze their usage
  
    - production break  
      Set interrupt flag on specific productions.
  
    - production excise  
      This command removes productions from Soar’s memory.
  
    - production find  
      Find productions that contain a given pattern.
  
    - production firing-counts  
      Print the number of times productions have fired.
  
    - production matches  
      Print information about the match set and partial matches.
  
    - production memory-usage  
      Print memory usage for production matches.
  
    - production optimize-attribute  
      Declare an attribute as multi-attributes so as to increase
      Rete production matching efficiency.
  
    - production watch  
      Trace firings and retractions of specific productions.

**sp** is of course used in virtually all Soar programming. Of the remaining
commands, **soar** and production memory-usage are most often used. **production
find** is especially useful when the number of productions loaded is high.
**production firing-counts** is used to see if how many times certain rules
fire. **production watch** is related to **wm watch** , but applies only to
specific, named productions.

## Short-term Memory Commands

This section describes the commands for interacting with working memory
and preference memory, seeing what productions will match and fire in
the next Propose or Apply phase, and examining the goal dependency set.
These commands are particularly useful when running or debugging Soar,
as they let users see what Soar is "thinking." Also included in this
section is information about using Soar’s Spatial Visual System (SVS),
which filters perceptual input into a form usable in symbolic working
memory.

The specific commands described in this section are:

- [print](../reference/cli/cmd_print.md#print)  
  Print items in working, semantic and production memory. Can
  also print the print the WMEs in the goal dependency set for each
  goal.

- [wm](../reference/cli/cmd_wm.md#wm)  
  Commands and settings related to working memory and working memory
  activation.
  
    - wm activation  
      Get/Set working memory activation parameters.
  
    - wm add  
      Manually add an element to working memory.
  
    - wm remove  
      Manually remove an element from working memory.
  
    - wm watch  
      Print information about wmes that match a certain pattern
      as they are added and removed.

- [preferences](../reference/cli/cmd_preferences.md#preferences)  
  Examine items in preference memory.

- [svs](../reference/cli/cmd_svs.md#svs)  
  Perform spatial visual system commands.

Of these commands, **print** is the most often used (and the most
complex). **print –gds** is useful for examining the goal dependency set
when subgoals seem to be disappearing unexpectedly. **preferences** is
used to examine which candidate operators have been proposed.

## Learning

This section describes the commands for enabling and configuring Soar’s
mechanisms of chunking and reinforcement learning. The specific commands
described in this section are:

- [chunk](../reference/cli/cmd_chunk.md#chunk)  
  Set the parameters for explanation-based chunking, Soar’s
  learning mechanism.

- [rl](../reference/cli/cmd_rl.md#rl)  
  Get/Set RL parameters and statistics.

## Long-term Declarative Memory

This section describes the commands for enabling and configuring Soar’s
long-term semantic memory and episodic memory systems. The specific
commands described in this section are:

- [smem](../reference/cli/cmd_smem.md#smem)  
  Get/Set semantic memory parameters and statistics.

- [epmem](../reference/cli/cmd_epmem.md#epmem)  
  Get/Set episodic memory parameters and statistics.

## Other Debugging Commands

This section describes the commands used primarily for debugging or to
configure the trace output printed by Soar as it runs. Many of these
commands provide options that simplify or restrict runtime behavior to
enable easier and more localized debugging. Users may specify the
content of the runtime trace output, examine the backtracing information
that supports generated justifications and chunks, or request details on
Soar’s performance.

The specific commands described in this section are:

- [trace](../reference/cli/cmd_trace.md#trace)  
  Control the information printed as Soar runs. *(was watch)*

- [output](../reference/cli/cmd_output.md#output)  
  Controls sub-commands and settings related to Soar’s output.
  
    - output enabled  
      Toggles printing at the lowest level.
  
    - output console  
      Redirects printing to the the terminal. Most users will not
      change this.
  
    - output callbacks  
      Toggles standard Soar agent callback-based printing.
  
    - output log  
      Record all user-interface input and output to a file.
  
    - output command-to-file  
      Dump the printed output and results of a command to a file.
  
    - output print-depth  
      Set how many generations of an identifier’s children that
      Soar will print
  
    - output warnings  
      Toggle whether or not warnings are printed.
  
    - output verbose  
      Control detailed information printed as Soar runs.
  
    - output echo-commands  
      Set whether or not commands are echoed to other connected
      debuggers.

- [explain](../reference/cli/cmd_explain.md#explain)  
  Provides interactive exploration of why a rule was learned.

- [visualize](../reference/cli/cmd_visualize.md#visualize)  
  Creates graph visualizations of Soar’s memory systems or
  processing.

- [stats](../reference/cli/cmd_stats.md#stats)  
  Print information on Soar’s runtime statistics.

- [debug](../reference/cli/cmd_debug.md#debug)  
  Contains commands that provide access to Soar’s internals. Most
  users will not need to access these commands
  
    - debug allocate  
      Allocate additional 32 kilobyte blocks of memory for a
      specified memory pool without running Soar.
  
    - debug port  
      Returns the port the kernel instance is listening on.
  
    - debug time  
      Uses a default system clock timer to record the wall time
      required while executing a command.
  
    - debug internal-symbols  
      Print information about the Soar symbol table.

Of these commands, **trace** is the most often used (and the most complex).  
**output print-depth** is related to the **print** command. **stats** is useful
*for understanding how much work Soar is doing.

## File System I/O Commands

This section describes commands which interact in one way or another
with operating system input and output, or file I/O. Users can
save/retrieve information to/from files, redirect the information
printed by Soar as it runs, and save and load the binary representation
of productions. The specific commands described in this section are:

- [cd](../reference/cli/cmd_file_system.md#cd)  
  Change directory.

- [dirs](../reference/cli/cmd_file_system.md#dirs)  
  List the directory stack.

- [load](../reference/cli/cmd_load.md#load)  
  Loads soar files, rete networks, saved percept streams and
  external libraries.
  
    - load file  
      Sources a file containing soar commands and productions.
      May also contain Tcl code if Tcl mode is enabled.
  
    - load library  
      Loads an external library that extends functionality of
      Soar.
  
    - load rete-network  
      Loads a rete network that represents rules loaded in
      production memory.
  
    - load library  
      Loads soar files, rete networks, saved percept streams and
      external libraries.

- ls  
  List the contents of the current working directory.

- popd  
  Pop the current working directory off the stack and change to
  the next directory on the stack.

- pushd  
  Push a directory onto the directory stack, changing to it.

- pwd  
  Print the current working directory.

- [save](../reference/cli/cmd_save.md#save)  
  Saves chunks, rete networks and percept streams.
  
    - save agent  
      Saves the agent’s procedural and semantic memories and
      settings to a single file.
  
    - save chunks  
      Saves chunks into a file.
  
    - save percepts  
      Saves future input link structures into a file.
  
    - save rete-network  
      Saves the current rete networks that represents rules
      loaded in production memory.

- [echo](../reference/cli/cmd_echo.md#echo)  
  Prints a string to the current output device.

(See also the [output command](../reference/cli/cmd_output.md#ouput).)

The **load file** command, previously known as **source**, is used for nearly every
Soar program. The directory functions are important to understand so that users
can navigate directories/folders to load/save the files of interest. Saving and
loading percept streams are used mainly when Soar needs to interact with an
external environment. Soar applications that include a graphical interface or
other simulation environment will often require the use of **echo**. Users might take
advantage of these commands when debugging agents, but care should be used in
adding and removing WMEs this way as they do not fall under Soar’s truth
maintenance system.
