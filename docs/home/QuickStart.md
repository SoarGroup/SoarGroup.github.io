# Soar Quick Start Guide

<!-- TODO: face palm emoji: ðŸ¤¦ please just restructure the release to simplify
this for everyone -->

Pre-requisite: if you would like to use the graphical applications included with
Soar, such as the debugger and VisualSoar, you will need
[Java version 11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?variant=openjdk11) or
higher installed.

1.  Download Soar Release archive
[here](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/releases/download/releases%2F{{soar_version}}/SoarSuite_{{soar_version}}-Multiplatform.zip)<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->
and extract to the location of your choice.

2.  Run the Soar debugger via one of the scripts included in this folder:

    -   Windows users can double-click on `SoarJavaDebugger.bat`
    -   Linux/Mac users can run `./SoarJavaDebugger.sh` from the terminal

The other included applications are used in the tutorial, which is included under
`documentation/`. The manuals for Soar and VisualSoar can be found there, as
well.

You can also build Soar from [source](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar) if
you'd like to work with the latest version or make changes to it.

Once you have Soar running, you can follow the
[Soar Tutorial](../tutorials/soar_tutorial/index.md) to learn how to use it.
